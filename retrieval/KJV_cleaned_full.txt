[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:1] In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:2] And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:3] And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:4] And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:5] And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:6] And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:7] And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:8] And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:9] And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:10] And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:11] And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:12] And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:13] And the evening and the morning were the third day.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:14] And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:16] And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:17] And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:19] And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:20] And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:21] And God created great whales, and every living creature that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:22] And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:23] And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:24] And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:25] And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:26] And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:27] So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:28] And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:29] And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:30] And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 1:31] And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:1] Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:2] And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:3] And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:4] These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:6] But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:7] And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:8] And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:9] And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:10] And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:11] The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:13] And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:14] And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:15] And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:16] And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:18] And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:19] And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:20] And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:21] And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:23] And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:24] Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 2:25] And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:1] Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:3] But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:4] And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 3:5
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:6] And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:7] And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:8] And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:9] And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:11] And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:12] And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:13] And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:14] And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:16] Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:17] And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:20] And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:21] Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:22] And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 3:24] So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:1] And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:2] And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:3] And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:4] And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:6] And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:8] And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:9] And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:11] And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:13] And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:14] Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:15] And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:16] And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:17] And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:18] And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:19] And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:20] And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:21] And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:22] And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:23] And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:24] If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:25] And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 4:26] And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 5:1] This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 5:3] And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 5:6] And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 5:7 And
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 5:9] And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 5:10 And Enos lived
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 5:12] And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel: 5:13 And
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 5:15] And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 5:16
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 5:18] And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 5:21] And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 5:22
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 5:25] And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 5:26] And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 5:28] And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 5:30] And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 5:32] And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:1] And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:3] And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:4] There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:5] And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:6] And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:7] And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:8] But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:9] These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:10] And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:11] The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:12] And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:13] And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:14] Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:15] And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:16] A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:17] And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:18] But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:19] And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:20] Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:21] And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 6:22] Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:1] And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:2] Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:3] Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:4] For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:5] And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:6] And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:7] And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:8] Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:10] And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:11] In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:12] And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:13] In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:15] And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:16] And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:17] And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:18] And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:19] And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:20] Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:21] And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:23] And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 7:24] And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 8:1] And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 8:4] And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 8:5] And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 8:6] And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 8:8] Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 8:10] And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 8:12] And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 8:13] And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 8:14] And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 8:15] And God spake unto Noah, saying, 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 8:17] Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 8:18] And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 8:20] And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 8:21] And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 8:22] While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:1] And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:2] And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:3] Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:4] But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:5] And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:6] Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:7] And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:8] And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9:9 And
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:11] And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:12] And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:14] And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:16] And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:17] And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:18] And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:19] These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:20] And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:21] And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:22] And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:23] And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:24] And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:25] And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:26] And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:27] God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:28] And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 9:29] And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:1] Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:2] The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:3] And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:4] And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:5] By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:6] And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:7] And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:8] And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:9] He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:10] And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:11] Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:13] And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:14] And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:15] And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 10:16 And the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:19] And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:20] These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:21] Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:22] The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:23] And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:24] And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:25] And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:26] And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:30] And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:31] These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 10:32] These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:1] And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:2] And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:3] And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:4] And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:5] And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:6] And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:7] Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:8] So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:9] Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:10] These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:12] And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 11:13
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:14] And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 11:15 And Salah
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:16] And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 11:17 And
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:18] And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 11:19 And Peleg
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:20] And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 11:21 And
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:22] And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 11:23 And Serug
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:24] And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 11:25
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:26] And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:27] Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:28] And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:29] And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:30] But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:31] And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 11:32] And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 12:1] Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 12:4] So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 12:5] And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 12:6] And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 12:7] And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 12:8] And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 12:9] And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 12:10] And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 12:11] And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 12:13] Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 12:14] And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 12:15] The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 12:16] And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 12:17] And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 12:18] And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 12:20] And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 13:1] And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 13:2] And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 13:3] And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 13:5] And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 13:6] And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 13:7] And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 13:8] And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 13:9] Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 13:10] And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 13:11] Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 13:12] Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 13:13] But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 13:14] And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 13:16] And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 13:17] Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 13:18] Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:1] And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:3] All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:4] Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:5] And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:7] And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:8] And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:10] And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:11] And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:12] And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:13] And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:14] And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:15] And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:16] And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:17] And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:18] And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:19] And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:21] And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:22] And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 14:23] That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 15:1] After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 15:2] And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 15:3] And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 15:4] And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 15:5] And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 15:6] And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 15:7] And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 15:8] And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 15:10] And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 15:11] And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 15:12] And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 15:13] And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 15:15] And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 15:16] But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 15:17] And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 15:18] In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 16:1] Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no children: and she had an
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 16:2] And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 16:3] And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 16:4] And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 16:5] And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 16:6] But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 16:7] And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 16:8] And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? and whither
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 16:9] And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 16:10] And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 16:11] And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 16:12] And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 16:13] And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 16:15] And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son’s name,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 16:16] And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:1] And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:2] And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:3] And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 17:4
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:5] Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:6] And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:7] And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:8] And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:9] And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:10] This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:11] And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:12] And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:13] He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:14] And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:15] And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:16] And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:17] Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:20] And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:21] But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:22] And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:23] And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:24] And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:25] And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:26] In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 17:27] And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:1] And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:6] And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:7] And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:8] And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:9] And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:10] And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:11] Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:12] Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:15] Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:16] And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:17] And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:19] For I know him, that he will command his children and his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:20] And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:22] And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:23] And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:27] And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:29] And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:30] And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:31] And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:32] And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 18:33] And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:1] And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:3] And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:4] But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:6] And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:8] Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:9] And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:10] But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:11] And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:12] And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:14] And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:15] And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:16] And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:17] And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:18] And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 19:19 Behold now,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:21] And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:22] Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:23] The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:24] Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:26] But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:27] And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:29] And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:30] And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:31] And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:33] And they made their father drink wine that night: and the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:34] And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:35] And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:36] Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:37] And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 19:38] And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 20:1] And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 20:2] And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 20:3] But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 20:4] But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 20:6] And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 20:7] Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 20:8] Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 20:9] Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 20:10] And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 20:12] And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 20:13] And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 20:14] And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 20:15] And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 20:16] And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 20:17] So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 20:18] For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:1] And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:2] For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:3] And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:4] And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:5] And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:6] And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:7] And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:8] And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:9] And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:10] Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:11] And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:12] And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:13] And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:14] And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:15] And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:16] And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:17] And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:18] Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:19] And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:20] And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:21] And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:22] And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:24] And Abraham said, I will swear.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:25] And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:26] And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:27] And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:28] And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:29] And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:31] Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:32] Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:33] And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 21:34] And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:1] And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:2] And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:3] And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:4] Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:5] And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:6] And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:7] And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:9] And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:10] And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:11] And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:12] And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:13] And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:14] And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:15] And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:19] So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:20] And it came to pass after these things, that it was told
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:23] And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 22:24] And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 23:1] And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 23:2] And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 23:3] And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 23:5] And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:6
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 23:7] And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 23:8] And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 23:10] And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 23:12] And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 23:13] And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 23:14] And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:15 My lord,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 23:16] And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 23:17] And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 23:19] And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 23:20] And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:1] And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:2] And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:5] And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:7] The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:8] And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:9] And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:10] And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:11] And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:12] And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:13] Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:15] And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:16] And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:17] And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:18] And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:19] And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:20] And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:21] And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:22] And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:25] She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:26] And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:27] And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:28] And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother’s house these
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:29] And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:30] And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:31] And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:32] And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:33] And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:34] And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:35] And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:36] And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:37] And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:38] But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:39] And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:40] And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:42] And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:45] And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:46] And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:47] And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:48] And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:49] And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:50] Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:51] Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:52] And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:53] And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:54] And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:55] And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:56] And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:57] And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:58] And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:59] And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:60] And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:61] And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:62] And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:63] And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:64] And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:65] For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:66] And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 24:67] And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:1] Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:2] And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:3] And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:4] And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:5] And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:6] But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:7] And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:8] Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:9] And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:11] And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:12] Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:17] And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:18] And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:19] And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:21] And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:22] And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:23] And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:24] And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:25] And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:26] And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:27] And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:28] And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:29] And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:31] And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:32] And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 25:34] Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:1] And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:2] And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:6] And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 26:7 And the men of the place asked him
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:8] And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:9] And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:10] And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:11] And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:12] Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:13] And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:15] For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:16] And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:17] And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:18] And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:19] And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:20] And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:21] And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:22] And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:23] And he went up from thence to Beersheba.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:24] And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:25] And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:26] Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:27] And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:30] And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:31] And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:32] And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:33] And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 26:34] And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:1] And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:2] And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:5] And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:6] And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:8] Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:9] Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:11] And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:13] And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:14] And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:15] And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:16] And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:18] And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:20] And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:21] And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:22] And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:23] And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:24] And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:25] And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:26] And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:27] And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:30] And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:31] And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:32] And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:33] And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:34] And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:35] And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:36] And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:39] And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:41] And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:42] And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 27:43] Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 28:2] Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 28:3] And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 28:5] And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 28:6] When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 28:10] And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 28:11] And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 28:12] And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 28:13] And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 28:15] And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 28:16] And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 28:17] And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 28:18] And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 28:19] And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 28:20] And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:1] Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:2] And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:3] And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:4] And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:5] And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:6] And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:7] And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:8] And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:9] And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father’s
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:10] And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:11] And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:12] And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:13] And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:14] And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:15] And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:17] Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:18] And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:19] And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:20] And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:21] And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:22] And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:23] And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:24] And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:25] And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:26] And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:27] Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:28] And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:29] And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:30] And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:31] And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:32] And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:33] And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:34] And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 29:35] And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:1] And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:2] And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:3] And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:4] And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:5] And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:6] And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:7] And Bilhah Rachel’s maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:8] And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:9] When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:10] And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a son.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:11] And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:12] And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a second son.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:13] And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:14] And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:15] And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:16] And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:17] And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:18] And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:19] And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:20] And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:21] And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:22] And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:23] And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:25] And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:26] Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:27] And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:28] And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:29] And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:30] For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:32] I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:33] So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:34] And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:35] And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:36] And he set three days’ journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:37] And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:38] And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:39] And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:40] And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:41] And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:42] But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 30:43] And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:1] And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:2] And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:3] And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:4] And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:6] And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:7] And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:8] If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:9] Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:10] And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:11] And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:12] And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:13] I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:14] And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:16] For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:17] Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:18] And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:19] And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:20] And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:21] So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:22] And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:23] And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:24] And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:25] Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:26] And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:28] And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:29] It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:30] And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:32] With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:33] And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:34] Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:35] And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:36] And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:38] This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:39] That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:40] Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:41] Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:42] Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:43] And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:44] Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:45] And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:46] And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:47] And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:48] And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:50] If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:51] And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:53] The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:54] Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 31:55] And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:1] And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:2] And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God’s host: and he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:3] And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:4] And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:6] And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:7] Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:9] And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:11] Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:12] And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:13] And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:16] And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:17] And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:19] And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:20] And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:21] So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:22] And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:23] And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:24] And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:25] And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:26] And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:27] And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:28] And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:29] And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:30] And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:31] And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 32:32] Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:1] And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:2] And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:3] And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:4] And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:5] And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:6] Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:7] And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:8] And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:9] And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:10] And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:11] Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:12] And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:13] And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:14] Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:15] And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:16] So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:17] And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:18] And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:19] And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 33:20] And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:1] And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:2] And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:3] And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:4] And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:5] And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:6] And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:7] And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:8] And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:9] And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:10] And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:11] And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:12] Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:13] And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:14] And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:15] But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:17] But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:18] And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:19] And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:20] And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:22] Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:23] Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:24] And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:25] And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:26] And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:27] The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:28] They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:30] And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 34:31] And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 35:1] And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 35:2] Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 35:4] And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 35:5] And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 35:6] So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 35:7] And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 35:8] But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 35:9] And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 35:10] And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 35:11] And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 35:13] And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 35:14] And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 35:15] And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 35:16] And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 35:17] And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the

[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:2] These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:3] Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:4] And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:5] And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:6] And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:8] And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:9] And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:10] And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:12] And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:13] And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:14] And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:15] And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:17] And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:18] And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:19] And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:20] Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:21] And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:22] And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:23] And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:25] And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:26] And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:28] Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:29] And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:30] And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:33] And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat; an evil beast
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:34] And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:35] And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 37:36] And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:1] And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:2] And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:3] And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:4] And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:5] And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:6] And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:7] And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:8] And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:9] And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:10] And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:11] Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:12] And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:13] And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:14] And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:15] When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:16] And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:19] And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:20] And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:21] Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:22] And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:23] And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:24] And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:25] When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:26] And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:27] And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:28] And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:29] And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 38:30] And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:1] And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:2] And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:3] And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:4] And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:5] And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:6] And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:7] And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:8] But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:11] And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:12] And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:13] And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:16] And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:17] And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:19] And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:20] And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, a
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:21] But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:22] And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 39:23] The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 40:1] And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 40:2] And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 40:3] And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 40:4] And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 40:5] And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 40:6] And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 40:7] And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that were with him in the ward of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 40:9] And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 40:12] And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 40:14] But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 40:16] When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 40:18] And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 40:20] And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 40:21] And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 40:23] Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:1] And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:2] And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:3] And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:4] And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:5] And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:6] And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:7] And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:8] And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:9] Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:12] And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:13] And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:14] Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:15] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:16] And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:17] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:22] And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:25] And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:26] The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:27] And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:28] This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:29] Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:32] And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:33] Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:34] Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:35] And let them gather all the food of those good years that come,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:36] And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:37] And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:38] And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:41] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:42] And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:44] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:45] And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:46] And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:47] And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:48] And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:49] And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:50] And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:51] And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:52] And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:53] And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:54] And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:55] And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:56] And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 41:57] And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:1] Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:3] And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:4] But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:5] And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:6] And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:7] And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:8] And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:9] And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:10] And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:11] We are all one man’s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:12] And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:13] And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:14] And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:16] Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:17] And he put them all together into ward three days.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:18] And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:21] And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:22] And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:23] And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:24] And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:25] Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:26] And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:27] And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:28] And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:31] And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32 We
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:33] And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:35] And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:36] And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:37] And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 42:38] And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:1] And the famine was sore in the land.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:2] And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:3] And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:4] If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:6] And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:9] I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:11] And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:15] And the men took that present, and they took double money in
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:16] And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:17] And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:18] And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:19] And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:22] And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:23] And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:24] And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:25] And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:26] And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:27] And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:29] And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:30] And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:31] And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:32] And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:33] And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 43:34] And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:1] And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:2] And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:3] As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:4] And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:6] And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:7] And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:10] And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:11] Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:12] And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:13] Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:14] And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he was
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:15] And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:17] And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:18] Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:19] My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:21] And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:22] And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:23] And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:24] And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:25] And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:26] And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:27] And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:30] Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:31] It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:32] For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:33] Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 44:34] For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me?
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:1] Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:2] And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:3] And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:4] And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:5] Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:6] For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:7] And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:8] So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:9] Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:12] And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:13] And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:14] And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:15] Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:16] And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:17] And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:19] Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:20] Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:21] And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:22] To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:23] And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:24] So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:25] And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 45:27] And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:1] And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:2] And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:3] And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:5] And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:6] And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:8] And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:9] And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:10] And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:11] And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:12] And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:13] And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:14] And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:15] These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:16] And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:17] And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:18] These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:19] The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:20] And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:21] And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:22] These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:23] And the sons of Dan; Hushim.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:24] And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:25] These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:26] All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:28] And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:29] And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:30] And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:31] And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:32] And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 46:33] And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:1] Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:2] And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:3] And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:4] They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:5] And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:7] And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:8] And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou? 47:9 And Jacob
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:10] And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:11] And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:12] And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:13] And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:14] And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:15] And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:16] And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:17] And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:18] When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:19] Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:20] And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:21] And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:22] Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:23] Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:24] And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:25] And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:26] And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:27] And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:28] And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:29] And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 47:31] And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:1] And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:2] And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:3] And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:5] And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:6] And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:7] And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:8] And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who are these? 48:9
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:10] Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:11] And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:12] And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:13] And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:14] And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:15] And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:17] And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:18] And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:19] And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:20] And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:21] And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 48:22] Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:1] And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:2] Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:3] Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:5] Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:6] O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly,
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:7] Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:8] Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:9] Judah is a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:11] Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:13] Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:14] Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:15] And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:16] Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:17] Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:18] I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:19] Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:20] Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:21] Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:22] Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:27] Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:28] All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:29] And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:31] There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:32] The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 49:33] And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:1] And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:2] And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:3] And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:4] And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:6] And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:7] And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:9] And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:10] And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:11] And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:12] And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 50:13
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:14] And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:15] And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:16] And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:18] And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:19] And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:21] Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:22] And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:23] And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation: the
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:24] And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:25] And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God
[First Book of Moses: Called Genesis 50:26] So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 1:1] Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 1:2] Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 1:5] And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 1:6] And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 1:7] And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 1:8] Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 1:9] And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 1:11] Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 1:12] But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 1:13] And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 1:15] And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 1:17] But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 1:18] And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 1:20] Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 1:21] And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 1:22] And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:1] And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:2] And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:3] And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:4] And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:5] And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:6] And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:7] Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:9] And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:10] And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter,
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:11] And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:12] And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:13] And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:15] Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:16] Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:17] And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:18] And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:20] And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:21] And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:22] And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:23] And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:24] And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 2:25] And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 3:1] Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 3:2] And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 3:3] And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 3:4] And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 3:5] And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 3:6] Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 3:7] And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 3:9] Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 3:10] Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 3:11] And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 3:12] And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 3:13] And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 3:15] And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
[Second Book of Moses: Called Exodus 3:16] Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 3:18] And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 3:19] And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 3:20] And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 3:21] And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 3:22] But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:1] And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:2] And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:3] And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:4] And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:6] And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:7] And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:8] And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:9] And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:10] And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:11] And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man’s mouth? or who
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:13] And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:14] And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:15] And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:16] And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:17] And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:18] And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:19] And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt:
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:20] And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:21] And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:22] And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:24] And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:25] Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:26] So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:27] And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:28] And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:29] And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 4:31] And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:1] And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:2] And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:3] And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:4] And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:5] And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:6] And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:8] And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:9] Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:10] And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:11] Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:12] So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:13] And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:14] And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:17] But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:18] Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:19] And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:20] And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:22] And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 5:23] For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:1] Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:2] And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: 6:3
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:4] And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:5] And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:6] Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:8] And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:9] And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:10] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:11 Go in, speak unto
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:12] And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:14] These be the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:15] And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:16] And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:17] The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:18] And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel:
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:19] And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:20] And Amram took him Jochebed his father’s sister to wife; and she
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:21] And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:22] And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:23] And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:24] And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:25] And Eleazar Aaron’s son took him one of the daughters of Putiel
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:26] These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:27] These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:28] And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 6:30] And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:2] Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:3] And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:4] But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:5] And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:6] And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:7] And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:8] And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 7:9 When
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:10] And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:11] Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:12] For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents:
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:13] And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not unto them;
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:14] And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh’s heart is hardened, he
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:15] Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:16] And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:17] Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD:
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:18] And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:19] And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:20] And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:21] And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:22] And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:23] And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:24] And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 7:25] And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:2] And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:4] And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:5] And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:6] And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:7] And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:8] Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:9] And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:11] And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:12] And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:13] And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:14] And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:15] But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:16] And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:17] And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:18] And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:19] Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God:
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:20] And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:21] Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:22] And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:23] And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:24] And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:25] And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:26] And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:28] And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:29] And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:30] And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:31] And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 8:32] And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:1] Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:2] For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 9:3
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:4] And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:5] And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:6] And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:7] And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:8] And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:9] And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:10] And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:11] And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:12] And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:13] And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:14] For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:15] For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:16] And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:17] As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:19] Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:20] He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:22] And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:23] And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:24] So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:25] And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:26] Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:27] And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:28] Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:29] And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:30] But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:31] And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:32] But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:33] And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:34] And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 9:35] And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:1] And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:3] And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:4] Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:7] And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:10] And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:11] Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:12] And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:13] And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:14] And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:15] For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:16] Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:17] Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:18] And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:19] And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:20] But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:21] And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:22] And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:24] And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD;
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:25] And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:26] Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:27] But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:28] And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 10:29] And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 11:1] And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 11:2] Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 11:3] And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 11:4] And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 11:6] And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 11:7] But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 11:8] And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 11:9] And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 11:10] And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:3] Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:5] Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:7] And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:8] And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:9] Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:10] And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:11] And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:12] For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:13] And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:14] And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:15] Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:16] And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:17] And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:18] In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:19] Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:20] Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:21] Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:22] And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:23] For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:24] And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:25] And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:26] And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:28] And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:29] And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:30] And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:31] And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:32] Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:33] And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:34] And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:35] And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:37] And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:38] And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:39] And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:40] Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:41] And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:42] It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:43] And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:45] A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:46] In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:47] All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:48] And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:49] One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:50] Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 12:51] And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Sanctify unto me all
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:3] And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:4] This day came ye out in the month Abib.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:5] And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:6] Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:7] Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:8] And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:9] And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:10] Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:11] And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:13] And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:14] And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:15] And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:16] And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:17] And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:19] And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:20] And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 13:21] And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14:2 Speak unto the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:3] For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:4] And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, that he shall follow after
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:5] And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:8] And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:9] But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:10] And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:11] And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:13] And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:14] The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:15] And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:17] And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:18] And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:19] And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:21] And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:22] And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:23] And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:24] And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:26] And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:27] And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:28] And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:29] But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:30] Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 14:31] And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:1] Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:2] The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation:
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:3] The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:4] Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:5] The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:6] Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:7] And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:8] And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:9] The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:10] Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:11] Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:13] Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:14] The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:15] Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:16] Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:17] Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:18] The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:19] For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:20] And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:21] And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:22] So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:23] And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:24] And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 15:27] And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:1] And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:2] And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:4] Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:5] And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:6] And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:9] And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:10] And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:11] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:12 I have heard the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:13] And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:14] And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:15] And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:16] This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:17] And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:18] And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:19] And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:20] Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:21] And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:22] And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:23] And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:24] And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:25] And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:26] Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:27] And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:28] And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:30] So the people rested on the seventh day.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:31] And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:32] And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:33] And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:34] As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:35] And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 16:36] Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 17:1] And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 17:2] Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 17:5] And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 17:6] Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 17:7] And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 17:9] And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 17:10] So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek:
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 17:11] And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 17:12] But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 17:13] And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 17:14] And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 17:15] And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:1] When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father in law, heard of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:3] And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:7] And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:8] And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:9] And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:10] And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:11] Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:12] And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took a burnt offering and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:13] And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:14] And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:17] And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:18] Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:19] Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:21] Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:23] If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:24] So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:25] And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:26] And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 18:27] And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:1] In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:2] For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:3] And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:5] Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:7] And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:8] And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:9] And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:10] And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:12] And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:14] And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:15] And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:16] And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:17] And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:18] And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:19] And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:20] And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:21] And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:22] And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:23] And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:24] And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 19:25] So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:1] And God spake all these words, saying, 20:2 I am the LORD thy
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:3] Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:4] Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:5] Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:7] Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:8] Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:9] Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 20:10 But the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:12] Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:13] Thou shalt not kill.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:14] Thou shalt not commit adultery.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:15] Thou shalt not steal.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:16] Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:17] Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:18] And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:19] And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear:
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:20] And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:21] And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:22] And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:23] Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 20:24] An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice

[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 28:11] With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 28:12] And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the

[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 28:27] And two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put them
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 28:28] And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto

[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 28:30] And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 28:31] And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 28:32] And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 28:33] And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 28:35] And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be

[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 28:41] And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 28:42] And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:1] And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:3] And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the

[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:10] And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:11] And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:12] And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:13] And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:14] But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:15] Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:16] And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:17] And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:18] And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:19] And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:20] Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:21] And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:22] Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:25] And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:26] And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron’s
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:27] And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:29] And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons’ after him, to
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:30] And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:31] And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:32] And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:33] And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:34] And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:35] And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:36] And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:37] Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:38] Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:39] The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:41] And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:42] This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:43] And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:44] And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:45] And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 29:46] And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:1] And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:2] A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:3] And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:4] And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:5] And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:6] And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:7] And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:8] And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:9] Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:10] And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:11] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:12 When thou takest
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:13] This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:14] Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:15] The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:16] And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:17] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:18 Thou shalt also
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:19] For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:21] So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:22] Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:23 Take thou also
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:26] And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:29] And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:30] And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:31] And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:32] Upon man’s flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:33] Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:34] And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:37] And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 30:38] Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 31:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:2 See, I have called by
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 31:3] And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 31:4] To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 31:6] And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 31:9] And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 31:12] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:13 Speak thou also
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 31:14] Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you:
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 31:15] Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 31:16] Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 31:17] It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 31:18] And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:1] And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:2] And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:3] And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:4] And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:5] And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:6] And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:7] And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:9] And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:11] And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:12] Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:13] Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:14] And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:15] And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:16] And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:17] And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:18] And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:19] And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:20] And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:21] And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:23] For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:24] And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:25] And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:27] And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:28] And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:29] For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:30] And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:31] And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:32] Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:33] And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:34] Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 32:35] And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:1] And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:4] And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:5] For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:6] And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:7] And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:8] And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:9] And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:10] And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:11] And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:12] And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:13] Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:14] And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:15] And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:16] For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:17] And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:18] And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:19] And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:20] And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 33:21] And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:1] And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:2] And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:3] And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:4] And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:5] And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:6] And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:8] And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:9] And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:10] And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:11] Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:12] Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:15] Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:17] Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:18] The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:19] All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:20] But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:21] Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:22] And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:23] Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:24] For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:25] Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:26] The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:27] And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:28] And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:29] And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:30] And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:31] And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:32] And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:33] And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:34] But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 34:35] And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 35:1] And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 35:2] Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 35:3] Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 35:4] And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 35:5] Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 35:10] And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 35:15] And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 35:20] And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 35:21] And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every

[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 39:33] And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 39:36] The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread, 39:37
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 39:38] And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 39:42] According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 39:43] And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 40:2 On the first day of
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:3] And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:4] And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:5] And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:6] And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:7] And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:8] And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:9] And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:10] And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:11] And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:12] And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:13] And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:14] And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 40:15
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:16] Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:17] And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:18] And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:19] And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:20] And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:22] And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:23] And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:24] And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:25] And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:26] And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:28] And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:29] And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:30] And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:31] And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:33] And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:34] Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:35] And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:36] And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the
[LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of 40:38] For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 1:1] And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the

[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 2:10] And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron’s and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 2:11] No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 2:12] As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 2:13] And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 2:14] And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 2:15] And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 2:16] And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 3:1] And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer

[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 3:17] It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 4:2 Speak unto the children
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:4] And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:5] And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock’s blood,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:7] And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:8] And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:11] And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:13] And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:15] And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the

[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:20] And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:21] And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:22] When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance

[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:27] And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:29] And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:30] And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:31] And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:32] And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:33] And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 4:34] And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with

[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 5:2] Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 5:3] Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 5:4] Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 5:5] And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 5:7] And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 5:8] And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 5:10] And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 5:11] But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 5:12] Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 5:13] And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 5:14] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 5:15 If a soul commit a
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 5:16] And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 5:17] And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 5:18] And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 5:19] It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:2 If a soul sin, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:6] And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:8] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:9 Command Aaron and his
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:10] And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:11] And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:12] And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:13] The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:14] And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:15] And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:16] And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:17] It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:18] All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:19] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:20 This is the offering
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:21] In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:22] And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:23] For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:24] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:25 Speak unto Aaron and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:26] The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:27] Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:28] But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:29] All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 6:30] And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:1] Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:2] In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:3] And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:6] Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:7] As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:8] And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt offering, even the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:9] And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:10] And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the

[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:12] If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:13] Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:14] And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:15] And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:16] But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:17] But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:18] And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:19] And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten;
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:20] But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:21] Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:22] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:23 Speak unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:24] And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:25] For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:26] Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:27] Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:28] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:29 Speak unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:30] His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:31] And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:32] And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:33] He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:34] For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:35] This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 7:37] This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:2 Take Aaron and his sons
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:4] And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:5] And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:6] And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:7] And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:8] And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:9] And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:10] And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:11] And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:12] And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:13] And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and put coats upon them, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:14] And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:15] And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:16] And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:17] But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:18] And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:19] And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:20] And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:21] And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:22] And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:23] And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:24] And he brought Aaron’s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:25] And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:28] And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:29] And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:30] And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:31] And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:32] And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:33] And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:34] As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:35] Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 8:36] So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:1] And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:3] And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:5] And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:6] And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:7] And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:8] Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:9] And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:11] And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:12] And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented unto
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:13] And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:14] And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:15] And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:16] And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:17] And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:18] He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:20] And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:22] And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:23] And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 9:24] And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 10:1] And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 10:2] And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 10:3] Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 10:4] And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 10:5] So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 10:6] And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 10:7] And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 10:8] And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 10:9 Do not drink wine nor
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 10:12] And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 10:14] And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 10:15] The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 10:16] And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 10:19] And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:2] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:3] Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:4] Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:5] And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:6] And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:7] And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:8] Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:9] These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:10] And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:12] Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:13] And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:20] All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:21] Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:23] But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:24] And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:25] And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:26] The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:27] And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:28] And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:29] These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:31] These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:32] And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:33] And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:34] Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:35] And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:36] Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:37] And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:38] But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:39] And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:40] And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:41] And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:42] Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:43] Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:44] For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:45] For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 11:46] This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 12:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 12:2 Speak unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 12:3] And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 12:4] And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 12:5] But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 12:6] And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 12:7] Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 12:8] And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, 13:2 When a man
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:4] If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:6] And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:7] But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:8] And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the

[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:12] And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:14] But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:15] And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:16] Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:18] The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:21] But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:23] But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:24] Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot

[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:31] And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:34] And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:35] But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:36] Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:37] But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is

[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:41] And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 13:42] And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white

[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:13] And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:14] And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:16] And if any man’s seed of copulation go out from him, then he
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:17] And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:18] The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:19] And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:20] And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:21] And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:22] And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:23] And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:24] And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:25] And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:26] Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:27] And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:28] But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:29] And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:30] And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:31] Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 15:32] This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:3] Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:4] He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:5] And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:6] And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:7] And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:8] And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:9] And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD’s lot fell,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:10] But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:11] And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:15] Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:17] And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:18] And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:19] And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:20] And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:23] And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:25] And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:26] And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:27] And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:28] And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:29] And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:31] It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:32] And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 16:34] And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 17:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 17:2 Speak unto Aaron, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 17:6] And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 17:7] And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 17:8] And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 17:10] And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 17:11] For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 17:12] Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 17:13] And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 17:14] For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 17:15] And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 17:16] But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 18:2 Speak unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:3] After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:4] Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:5] Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:6] None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:7] The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:8] The nakedness of thy father’s wife shalt thou not uncover: it is
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:9] The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:10] The nakedness of thy son’s daughter, or of thy daughter’s
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:11] The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of thy
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:12] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister: she
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:13] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister: for
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:14] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:15] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:16] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife: it
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:17] Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:18] Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:19] Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:20] Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour’s wife,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:21] And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:22] Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:23] Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:24] Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:26] Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:29] For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 18:30] Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 19:2 Speak unto all the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:3] Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:4] Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:5] And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:6] It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow:
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:7] And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:8] Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:9] And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:10] And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:11] Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:12] And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:13] Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wages
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:14] Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:15] Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:16] Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people:
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:17] Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:18] Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:19] Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:20] And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:21] And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:22] And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:23] And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:24] But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:25] And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:26] Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:27] Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:28] Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:29] Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:30] Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:31] Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:32] Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:33] And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:34] But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:35] Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:36] Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 19:37] Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 20:2 Again, thou shalt say
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:3] And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:4] And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:5] Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:6] And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:7] Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:8] And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:9] For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:10] And the man that committeth adultery with another man’s wife,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:11] And the man that lieth with his father’s wife hath uncovered his
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:12] And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:13] If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:14] And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:15] And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death:
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:16] And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:17] And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:18] And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:19] And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:20] And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife, he hath uncovered
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:21] And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an unclean
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:22] Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:23] And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:24] But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:25] Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:26] And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 20:27] A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:1] And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:3] And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:4] But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:5] They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:6] They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:7] They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:8] Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:9] And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:10] And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:13] And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:14] A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:15] Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:16] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 21:17 Speak unto Aaron,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:18] For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:22] He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:23] Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 21:24] And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 22:2 Speak unto Aaron and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:3] Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:4] What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:7] And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:8] That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:9] They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:10] There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:11] But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:12] If the priest’s daughter also be married unto a stranger, she
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:13] But if the priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:14] And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:15] And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:17] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 22:18 Speak unto Aaron,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:20] But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:21] And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:22] Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:23] Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:24] Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:25] Neither from a stranger’s hand shall ye offer the bread of your
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:26] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 22:27 When a bullock, or
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:28] And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:29] And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:30] On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:31] Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 22:32] Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:2 Speak unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:3] Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:4] These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:5] In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD’s
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:6] And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:7] In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:8] But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:9] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:10 Speak unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:12] And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:13] And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:14] And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:15] And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:17] Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:18] And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:19] Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:20] And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:21] And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:22] And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:23] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:24 Speak unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:25] Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:26] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:27 Also on the tenth
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:28] And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:29] For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:30] And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:31] Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:32] It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:33] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:34 Speak unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:35] On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:36] Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:37] These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:39] Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:40] And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:41] And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:42] Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 23:44] And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 24:2 Command the children
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:3] Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:4] He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:5] And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof:
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:6] And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:7] And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:8] Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:9] And it shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; and they shall eat it in
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:10] And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:11] And the Israelitish woman’s son blasphemed the name of the Lord,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:13] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 24:14 Bring forth him
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:15] And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:16] And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:17] And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:18] And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:19] And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:21] And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:22] Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 24:23] And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, 25:2 Speak
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:3] Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:5] That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:6] And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:7] And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:8] And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:9] Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:10] And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:11] A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:12] For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:13] In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:14] And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:17] Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:18] Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:19] And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:20] And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:22] And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:23] The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:24] And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:25] If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:26] And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:28] But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:29] And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:30] And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:31] But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:32] Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:33] And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:34] But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:35] And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee;
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:36] Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:37] Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:38] I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:39] And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:40] But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:41] And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:42] For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:43] Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:44] Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:45] Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:46] And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:47] And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:50] And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:51] If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:52] And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:53] And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:54] And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 25:55] For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:1] Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:2] Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:3] If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:4] Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:5] And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:6] And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:7] And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:8] And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:9] For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:10] And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:11] And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:12] And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:13] I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:14] But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:17] And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:18] And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:19] And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:21] And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:22] I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:23] And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:25] And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:26] And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:27] And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:29] And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:30] And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:31] And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:32] And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:33] And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:34] Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:35] As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:36] And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:37] And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:38] And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:39] And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:40] If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:43] The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:44] And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:45] But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 26:46] These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 27:2 Speak unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:3] And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:4] And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:5] And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:6] And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:7] And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:8] But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:9] And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:10] He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:11] And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:13] But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:14] And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:15] And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:16] And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:17] If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:18] But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:19] And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:20] And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:21] But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:22] And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:24] In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:25] And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:26] Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD’s
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:27] And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:28] Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:29] None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed;
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:30] And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land,
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:31] And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:32] And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:33] He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he
[Third Book of Moses: Called Leviticus 27:34] These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 1:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 1:4] And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head

[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 6:21] This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 6:22] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:23 Speak unto Aaron and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 6:25] The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 6:27] And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 7:1] And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 7:4] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:5 Take it of them, that
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 7:6] And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 7:7] Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 7:9] But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 7:10] And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 7:11] And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 7:12] And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the

[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 7:54] On the eighth day offered Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur, prince of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 7:60] On the ninth day Abidan the son of Gideoni, prince of the

[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 7:84] This was the dedication of the altar, in the day when it was
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 7:87] All the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve bullocks, the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 7:88] And all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings were
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 7:89] And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:2 Speak unto Aaron and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:3] And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:4] And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:5] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:6 Take the Levites from
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:7] And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:8] Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:9] And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:12] And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:13] And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:14] Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:15] And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:16] For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:17] For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:18] And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:19] And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:20] And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:21] And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:22] And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 8:23] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:24 This is it that
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:3] In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:4] And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:5] And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:6] And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:9] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 9:10 Speak unto the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:11] The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:12] They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:13] But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:14] And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:15] And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:16] So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:17] And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:18] At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:19] And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:20] And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle;
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:21] And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:22] Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 9:23] At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 10:2 Make thee two
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:3] And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:4] And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:5] When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:6] When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:7] But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:8] And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets;
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:9] And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:10] Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:11] And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:12] And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:13] And they first took their journey according to the commandment
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:14] In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:15] And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:16] And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:17] And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:18] And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:19] And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:20] And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:21] And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:22] And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:23] And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:24] And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:25] And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:26] And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:27] And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:28] Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:29] And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:30] And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:31] And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:32] And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:33] And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days’
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:34] And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:35] And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 10:36] And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:1] And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:2] And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:3] And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:4] And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:7] And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:8] And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:9] And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:10] Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:11] And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:14] I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:15] And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:16] And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:17] And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:18] And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:19] Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:22] Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:24] And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:25] And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:26] But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:27] And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:28] And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:29] And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:31] And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:32] And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:33] And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:34] And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 11:35] And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 12:1] And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 12:2] And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 12:3] (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 12:5] And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 12:6] And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 12:7] My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 12:8] With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 12:9] And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 12:10] And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 12:11] And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 12:12] Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 12:13] And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 12:14] And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 12:15] And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 12:16] And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Send thou men, that
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:3] And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:4] And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:5] Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:6] Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:13] Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:14] Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:15] Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:16] These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:17] And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:18] And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:21] So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:22] And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:24] The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:25] And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:26] And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:27] And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:28] Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:29] The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:30] And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:31] But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:32] And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 13:33] And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:1] And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:2] And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:5] Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:6] And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:8] If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:9] Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:10] But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:11] And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:13] And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:14] And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:15] Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:17] And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:19] Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:20] And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: 14:21
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:22] Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:25] (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:26] And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 14:27 How
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:28] Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:30] Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:31] But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:32] But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:33] And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:34] After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:35] I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:36] And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:38] But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:39] And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:40] And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:41] And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:42] Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:43] For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:44] But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 14:45] Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:2 Speak unto the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:4] Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:5] And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:6] Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:7] And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:8] And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:10] And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:11] Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:12] According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:13] All that are born of the country shall do these things after
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:14] And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:15] One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:16] One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:17] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:18 Speak unto the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:20] Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:21] Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:22] And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:25] And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:27] And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:28] And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:29] Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:30] But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:31] Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:32] And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:33] And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:34] And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:35] And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:36] And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:37] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:38 Speak unto the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 15:41] I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:1] Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:6] This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; 16:7 And
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:8] And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:9] Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:15] And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:16] And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:18] And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:19] And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:20] And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 16:21
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:22] And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:24] Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:25] And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:26] And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:27] So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:28] And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:29] If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:30] But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:31] And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:33] They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:34] And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:35] And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:36] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:37 Speak unto Eleazar
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:38] The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:39] And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:41] But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:42] And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:43] And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:44] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:45 Get you up from
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:46] And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:47] And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:48] And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:49] Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 16:50] And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 17:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 17:2 Speak unto the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 17:3] And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi: for one
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 17:4] And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 17:5] And it shall come to pass, that the man’s rod, whom I shall
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 17:6] And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 17:7] And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 17:8] And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 17:9] And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 17:10] And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron’s rod again before the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 17:11] And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 17:12] And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 17:13] Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:2] And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:3] And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:4] And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:5] And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:6] And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:7] Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest’s
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:8] And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:9] This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:10] In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:11] And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:12] All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:13] And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:14] Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:15] Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:16] And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:17] But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:18] And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:19] All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:20] And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:21] And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:22] Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:23] But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:24] But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:25] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 18:26 Thus speak unto the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:27] And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:28] Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:29] Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:30] Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:31] And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 18:32] And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 19:2 This
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:3] And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:4] And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:7] Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:8] And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:9] And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:10] And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:11] He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:12] He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:13] Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:14] This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:15] And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:16] And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:17] And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:20] But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:21] And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 19:22] And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:1] Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:2] And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:3] And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:6] And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:7] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 20:8 Take the rod, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:9] And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:10] And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:12] And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:13] This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:14] And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:18] And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:19] And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:20] And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:21] Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:22] And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:23] And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:25] Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:27] And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:28] And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 20:29] And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:1] And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:2] And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:3] And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:4] And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:5] And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:6] And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:7] Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:8] And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:9] And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:10] And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:11] And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:12] From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:13] From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:14] Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:16] And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:17] Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:18] The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:21] And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:23] And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border:
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:24] And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:25] And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:26] For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:27] Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:29] Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:30] We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:31] Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:32] And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:33] And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:34] And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 21:35] So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:1] And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:2] And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:3] And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many:
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:4] And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:5] He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:7] And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:8] And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:9] And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:10] And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:12] And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:13] And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:14] And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:15] And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:16] And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:18] And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:19] Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:20] And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:21] And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:22] And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:23] And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:24] But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:25] And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:26] And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:27] And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:28] And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:30] And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:31] Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:32] And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:34] And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:35] And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:36] And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:37] And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:39] And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:40] And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 22:41] And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:1] And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:2] And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:3] And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:4] And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:5] And the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, Return unto
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:6] And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:7] And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:8] How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:10] Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:12] And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:14] And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:15] And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:16] And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:17] And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:21] He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:22] God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:23] Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:25] And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:26] But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:28] And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:29] And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 23:30] And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:1] And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:2] And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:3] And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:7] He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:8] God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:9] He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:10] And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:11] Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:12] And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:15] And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:18] And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:19] Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:20] And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:21] And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:22] Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:23] And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 24:25] And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 25:1] And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 25:2] And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 25:3] And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 25:4] And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 25:5] And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 25:6] And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 25:7] And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 25:9] And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 25:10] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 25:11 Phinehas, the son
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 25:12] Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 25:13] And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 25:14] Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 25:15] And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 25:16] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 25:17 Vex the Midianites,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 26:1] And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 26:3] And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of

[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 27:2] And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 27:4] Why should the name of our father be done away from among his
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 27:5] And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 27:6] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 27:7 The daughters of

[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 27:10] And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 27:11] And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 27:12] And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 27:13] And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 27:14] For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 27:15] And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying, 27:16 Let the LORD, the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 27:17] Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 27:18] And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 27:20] And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 27:21] And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 27:22] And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 27:23] And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 28:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 28:2 Command the children
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 28:3] And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 28:4] The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 28:6] It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 28:7] And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 28:8] And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 28:9] And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 28:11] And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 28:13] And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 28:14] And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a

[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 28:18] In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 28:23] Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 28:24] After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 28:25] And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye

[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 29:35] On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 29:39] These things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 29:40] And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 30:1] And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 30:2] If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 30:3] If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 30:5] But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 30:6] And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 30:8] But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it;
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 30:9] But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 30:10] And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 30:12] But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 30:13] Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 30:14] But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 30:15] But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 30:16] These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:1] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:2 Avenge the children
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:3] And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:4] Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:5] So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:6] And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:7] And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:8] And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:9] And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:10] And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:11] And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:12] And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:13] And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:14] And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:15] And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:16] Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:17] Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:18] But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:19] And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:20] And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:21] And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:24] And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:25] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:26 Take the sum of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:30] And of the children of Israel’s half, thou shalt take one
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:31] And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:32] And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:36] And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:38] And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD’s
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:39] And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:40] And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD’s
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:41] And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD’s heave offering,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:42] And of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided from
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:48] And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:49] And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:50] We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:51] And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:52] And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:53] (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 31:54] And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:1] Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:2] The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:6] And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:9] For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:10] And the LORD’s anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:13] And the LORD’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:14] And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers’ stead, an increase
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:15] For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:16] And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:18] We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:19] For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:20] And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:23] But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:24] Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep;
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:25] And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:26] Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:28] So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:31] And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 32:32] We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan,

[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 36:3] And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 36:4] And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 36:5] And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 36:6] This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 36:7] So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 36:8] And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 36:9] Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 36:10] Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of
[Fourth Book of Moses: Called Numbers 36:13] These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:1] These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:2] (There are eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of mount
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:8] Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:9] And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:11] (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:13] Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:14] And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:15] So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:16] And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:17] Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:18] And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:19] And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:20] And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:21] Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:22] And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:23] And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:25] And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:26] Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:28] Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:29] Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:30] The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:32] Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God, 1:33 Who
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:34] And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:36] Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:37] Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:38] But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:39] Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:40] But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:41] Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:42] And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:43] So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:44] And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:45] And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 1:46] So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:1] Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:2] And the LORD spake unto me, saying, 2:3 Ye have compassed this
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:4] And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:6] Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:7] For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:8] And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:9] And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:10] The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:12] The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:13] Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:14] And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:15] For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:16] So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:18] Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:19] And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:20] (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:25] This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:26] And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:28] Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:30] But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:31] And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:32] Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:33] And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:34] And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 2:36] From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:1] Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:2] And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:3] So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:4] And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:5] All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars;
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:6] And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:7] But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:8] And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:11] For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:12] And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:13] And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:14] Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:15] And I gave Gilead unto Machir.
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:16] And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:18] And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:19] But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:21] And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:22] Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:23] And I besought the LORD at that time, saying, 3:24 O Lord GOD,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:26] But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:27] Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:28] But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 3:29] So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:1] Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:2] Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:3] Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:4] But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:5] Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:6] Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:7] For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:11] And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:12] And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:13] And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:14] And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:15] Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:20] But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:21] Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:22] But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:23] Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:24] For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:25] When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and ye
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:27] And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:28] And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:29] But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:30] When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:32] For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:35] Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:36] Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:37] And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:39] Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:40] Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:41] Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:44] And this is the law which Moses set before the children of
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 4:46] On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:1] And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:2] The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:3] The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:4] The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:7] Thou shalt have none other gods before me.
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:8] Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:11] Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:12] Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:13] Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work: 5:14 But the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:15] And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:16] Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:17] Thou shalt not kill.
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:18] Neither shalt thou commit adultery.
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:19] Neither shalt thou steal.
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:20] Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:21] Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour’s wife, neither shalt
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:22] These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:23] And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:25] Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:26] For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:28] And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:29] O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:31] But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:32] Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 5:33] Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 6:1] Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 6:3] Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 6:4] Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: 6:5 And thou shalt
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 6:6] And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 6:8] And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 6:9] And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 6:10] And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 6:13] Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 6:14] Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 6:16] Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 6:17] Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 6:18] And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 6:19] To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 6:20] And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 6:24] And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 6:25] And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:1] When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:3] Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:4] For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:5] But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:6] For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:7] The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:9] Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:11] Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:12] Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:13] And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:14] Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:15] And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:16] And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:17] If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I;
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:20] Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:21] Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:22] And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:23] But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:24] And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:25] The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 7:26] Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 8:1] All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 8:2] And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 8:3] And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 8:4] Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 8:5] Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 8:6] Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 8:7] For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 8:10] When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 8:11] Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 8:18] But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 8:19] And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 8:20] As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:1] Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:4] Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:5] Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:6] Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:7] Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:8] Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:9] When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:11] And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:12] And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:13] Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:15] So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:16] And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:17] And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:18] And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:19] For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:20] And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:21] And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:22] And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:23] Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:24] Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:25] Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:26] I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:27] Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 9:29] Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:1] At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:2] And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:3] And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:4] And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:5] And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:6] And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:7] From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:8] At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:9] Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren;
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:10] And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:11] And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:12] And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:15] Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:16] Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:17] For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:19] Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:20] Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:21] He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 10:22] Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:1] Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:2] And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:3] And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:7] But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:8] Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:10] For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:13] And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:14] That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:15] And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:16] Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:18] Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:19] And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:20] And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:22] For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:24] Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:25] There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:26] Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; 11:27
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:29] And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:30] Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 11:32] And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:1] These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:2] Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:4] Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:5] But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:8] Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:9] For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:10] But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:13] Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:15] Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:16] Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:17] Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:19] Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:20] When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:21] If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:22] Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:23] Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:24] Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:25] Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:26] Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:28] Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:29] When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:31] Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 12:32] What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 13:1] If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 13:4] Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 13:5] And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 13:6] If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 13:10] And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 13:11] And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 13:12] If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 13:16] And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 13:17] And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand:
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 14:1] Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 14:2] For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 14:3] Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 14:4] These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 14:6] And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 14:7] Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 14:8] And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 14:9] These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 14:11] Of all clean birds ye shall eat.

[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 28:61] Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 28:62] And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 28:63] And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 28:64] And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 28:65] And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 28:68] And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 29:1] These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 29:2] And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 29:5] And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 29:6] Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 29:7] And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 29:9] Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 29:10] Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 29:14] Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 29:15] But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 29:21] And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 29:28] And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 29:29] The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 30:1] And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 30:4] If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 30:6] And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 30:7] And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 30:8] And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 30:9] And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 30:11] For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 30:12] It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 30:15] See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 30:17] But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 30:19] I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:1] And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:2] And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:3] The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:4] And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:5] And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:6] Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them:
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:7] And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:8] And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:9] And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:10] And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:12] Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and thy
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:14] And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:15] And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud:
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:16] And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:17] Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:19] Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:20] For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:21] And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:22] Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:23] And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:24] And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:27] For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:29] For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 31:30] And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:1] Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:2] My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:4] He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:5] They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:6] Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:8] When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:9] For the LORD’s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:10] He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:11] As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:12] So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:13] He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:15] But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:16] They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:17] They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:18] Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:19] And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:20] And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:21] They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:22] For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:23] I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:24] They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:25] The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:26] I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:28] For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:29] O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:32] For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:33] Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:34] Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:36] For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:37] And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:39] See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:40] For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:41] If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:42] I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:43] Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:44] And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:45] And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:46] And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:47] For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:48] And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, 32:49
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:50] And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 32:52] Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:1] And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:2] And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:3] Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:4] Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:5] And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:6] Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:7] And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:8] And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:10] They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:11] Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands;
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:12] And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:13] And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:17] His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:18] And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:19] They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:20] And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:21] And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:22] And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion’s whelp: he shall leap from
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:23] And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:24] And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:25] Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:26] There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:27] The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:28] Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 33:29] Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 34:1] And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 34:4] And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 34:5] So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab,
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 34:6] And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 34:7] And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 34:8] And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 34:9] And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for
[Fifth Book of Moses: Called Deuteronomy 34:10] And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,
[Book of Joshua 1:1] Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to
[Book of Joshua 1:3] Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have
[Book of Joshua 1:4] From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river,
[Book of Joshua 1:5] There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days
[Book of Joshua 1:6] Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou
[Book of Joshua 1:7] Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe
[Book of Joshua 1:8] This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou
[Book of Joshua 1:9] Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not
[Book of Joshua 1:10] Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 1:11
[Book of Joshua 1:12] And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe
[Book of Joshua 1:14] Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in
[Book of Joshua 1:16] And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we
[Book of Joshua 1:17] According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we
[Book of Joshua 1:18] Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will
[Book of Joshua 2:1] And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy
[Book of Joshua 2:2] And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came
[Book of Joshua 2:3] And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the
[Book of Joshua 2:4] And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There
[Book of Joshua 2:6] But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them
[Book of Joshua 2:7] And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords:
[Book of Joshua 2:8] And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the
[Book of Joshua 2:10] For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea
[Book of Joshua 2:11] And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,
[Book of Joshua 2:12] Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I
[Book of Joshua 2:14] And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not
[Book of Joshua 2:15] Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her
[Book of Joshua 2:16] And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the
[Book of Joshua 2:17] And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine
[Book of Joshua 2:18] Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of
[Book of Joshua 2:19] And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy
[Book of Joshua 2:20] And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of
[Book of Joshua 2:21] And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent
[Book of Joshua 2:22] And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three
[Book of Joshua 2:23] So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and
[Book of Joshua 3:1] And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from
[Book of Joshua 3:2] And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went
[Book of Joshua 3:4] Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand
[Book of Joshua 3:5] And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to
[Book of Joshua 3:6] And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the
[Book of Joshua 3:7] And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify
[Book of Joshua 3:8] And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the
[Book of Joshua 3:9] And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear
[Book of Joshua 3:10] And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is
[Book of Joshua 3:11] Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth
[Book of Joshua 3:12] Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,
[Book of Joshua 3:13] And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of
[Book of Joshua 3:14] And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to
[Book of Joshua 3:17] And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD
[Book of Joshua 4:1] And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over
[Book of Joshua 4:4] Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the
[Book of Joshua 4:8] And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up
[Book of Joshua 4:9] And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the
[Book of Joshua 4:10] For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan,
[Book of Joshua 4:11] And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over,
[Book of Joshua 4:12] And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the
[Book of Joshua 4:14] On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel;
[Book of Joshua 4:15] And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 4:16 Command the priests
[Book of Joshua 4:17] Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of
[Book of Joshua 4:18] And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the
[Book of Joshua 4:19] And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the
[Book of Joshua 4:20] And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did
[Book of Joshua 4:21] And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your
[Book of Joshua 4:23] For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before
[Book of Joshua 5:1] And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which
[Book of Joshua 5:2] At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives,
[Book of Joshua 5:3] And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of
[Book of Joshua 5:4] And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people
[Book of Joshua 5:5] Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the
[Book of Joshua 5:6] For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,
[Book of Joshua 5:7] And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua
[Book of Joshua 5:8] And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the
[Book of Joshua 5:9] And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the
[Book of Joshua 5:10] And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the
[Book of Joshua 5:11] And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after
[Book of Joshua 5:12] And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the
[Book of Joshua 5:13] And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted
[Book of Joshua 6:1] Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of
[Book of Joshua 6:2] And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand
[Book of Joshua 6:3] And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round
[Book of Joshua 6:4] And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of
[Book of Joshua 6:5] And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with
[Book of Joshua 6:6] And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them,
[Book of Joshua 6:7] And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and
[Book of Joshua 6:8] And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that
[Book of Joshua 6:9] And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
[Book of Joshua 6:10] And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout,
[Book of Joshua 6:11] So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once:
[Book of Joshua 6:12] And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the
[Book of Joshua 6:13] And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before
[Book of Joshua 6:14] And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned
[Book of Joshua 6:15] And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early
[Book of Joshua 6:16] And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew
[Book of Joshua 6:17] And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are
[Book of Joshua 6:18] And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest
[Book of Joshua 6:19] But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are
[Book of Joshua 6:20] So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets:
[Book of Joshua 6:21] And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and
[Book of Joshua 6:22] But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the
[Book of Joshua 6:23] And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab,
[Book of Joshua 6:24] And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only
[Book of Joshua 6:25] And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s
[Book of Joshua 6:26] And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man
[Book of Joshua 6:27] So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout
[Book of Joshua 7:1] But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed
[Book of Joshua 7:2] And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven,
[Book of Joshua 7:3] And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the
[Book of Joshua 7:4] So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men:
[Book of Joshua 7:5] And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they
[Book of Joshua 7:6] And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face
[Book of Joshua 7:7] And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all
[Book of Joshua 7:12] Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their
[Book of Joshua 7:13] Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to
[Book of Joshua 7:14] In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your
[Book of Joshua 7:15] And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing
[Book of Joshua 7:16] So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by
[Book of Joshua 7:18] And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of
[Book of Joshua 7:19] And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to
[Book of Joshua 7:20] And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against
[Book of Joshua 7:22] So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,
[Book of Joshua 7:23] And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them
[Book of Joshua 7:24] And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,
[Book of Joshua 7:25] And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall
[Book of Joshua 7:26] And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So
[Book of Joshua 8:1] And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed:
[Book of Joshua 8:3] So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai:
[Book of Joshua 8:4] And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait
[Book of Joshua 8:7] Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city:
[Book of Joshua 8:8] And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set
[Book of Joshua 8:9] Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush,
[Book of Joshua 8:10] And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people,
[Book of Joshua 8:11] And all the people, even the people of war that were with him,
[Book of Joshua 8:12] And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in
[Book of Joshua 8:13] And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on
[Book of Joshua 8:14] And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted
[Book of Joshua 8:15] And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before
[Book of Joshua 8:16] And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue
[Book of Joshua 8:17] And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out
[Book of Joshua 8:18] And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in
[Book of Joshua 8:19] And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as
[Book of Joshua 8:20] And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold,
[Book of Joshua 8:21] And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the
[Book of Joshua 8:22] And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were
[Book of Joshua 8:23] And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
[Book of Joshua 8:24] And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all
[Book of Joshua 8:25] And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and
[Book of Joshua 8:26] For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the
[Book of Joshua 8:27] Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey
[Book of Joshua 8:28] And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a
[Book of Joshua 8:29] And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as
[Book of Joshua 8:30] Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount
[Book of Joshua 8:32] And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
[Book of Joshua 8:33] And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges,
[Book of Joshua 8:34] And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and
[Book of Joshua 8:35] There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua
[Book of Joshua 9:1] And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side
[Book of Joshua 9:2] That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and
[Book of Joshua 9:3] And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto
[Book of Joshua 9:6] And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto
[Book of Joshua 9:7] And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell
[Book of Joshua 9:10] And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were
[Book of Joshua 9:11] Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake
[Book of Joshua 9:12] This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on
[Book of Joshua 9:14] And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the
[Book of Joshua 9:15] And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to
[Book of Joshua 9:16] And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made
[Book of Joshua 9:17] And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities
[Book of Joshua 9:18] And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of
[Book of Joshua 9:19] But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn
[Book of Joshua 9:20] This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath
[Book of Joshua 9:21] And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be
[Book of Joshua 9:22] And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,
[Book of Joshua 9:24] And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told
[Book of Joshua 9:25] And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and
[Book of Joshua 9:26] And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of
[Book of Joshua 9:27] And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water
[Book of Joshua 10:1] Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard
[Book of Joshua 10:3] Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of
[Book of Joshua 10:5] Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,
[Book of Joshua 10:6] And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
[Book of Joshua 10:7] So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
[Book of Joshua 10:8] And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have
[Book of Joshua 10:9] Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal
[Book of Joshua 10:10] And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with
[Book of Joshua 10:11] And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were
[Book of Joshua 10:12] Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered
[Book of Joshua 10:13] And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people
[Book of Joshua 10:14] And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the
[Book of Joshua 10:15] And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
[Book of Joshua 10:16] But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at
[Book of Joshua 10:17] And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in
[Book of Joshua 10:18] And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,
[Book of Joshua 10:20] And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had
[Book of Joshua 10:21] And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in
[Book of Joshua 10:22] Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out
[Book of Joshua 10:23] And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out
[Book of Joshua 10:24] And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto
[Book of Joshua 10:25] And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong
[Book of Joshua 10:26] And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them
[Book of Joshua 10:27] And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,
[Book of Joshua 10:28] And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of
[Book of Joshua 10:29] Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto
[Book of Joshua 10:31] And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto
[Book of Joshua 10:33] Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
[Book of Joshua 10:34] And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with
[Book of Joshua 10:36] And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto
[Book of Joshua 10:38] And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and
[Book of Joshua 10:40] So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south,
[Book of Joshua 10:41] And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all
[Book of Joshua 10:42] And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,
[Book of Joshua 10:43] And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
[Book of Joshua 11:1] And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those
[Book of Joshua 11:4] And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much
[Book of Joshua 11:5] And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched
[Book of Joshua 11:6] And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for
[Book of Joshua 11:7] So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them
[Book of Joshua 11:8] And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote
[Book of Joshua 11:9] And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their
[Book of Joshua 11:10] And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote
[Book of Joshua 11:11] And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of
[Book of Joshua 11:12] And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,
[Book of Joshua 11:13] But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel
[Book of Joshua 11:14] And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children
[Book of Joshua 11:15] As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command
[Book of Joshua 11:16] So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south
[Book of Joshua 11:18] Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
[Book of Joshua 11:19] There was not a city that made peace with the children of
[Book of Joshua 11:20] For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should
[Book of Joshua 11:21] And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the
[Book of Joshua 11:22] There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children
[Book of Joshua 11:23] So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD
[Book of Joshua 12:1] Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel
[Book of Joshua 12:3] And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto
[Book of Joshua 12:6] Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel
[Book of Joshua 12:7] And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the
[Book of Joshua 12:10] The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 12:11 The
[Book of Joshua 13:1] Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto
[Book of Joshua 13:2] This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the
[Book of Joshua 13:6] All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto
[Book of Joshua 13:7] Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine
[Book of Joshua 13:13] Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites,
[Book of Joshua 13:14] Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the
[Book of Joshua 13:15] And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben
[Book of Joshua 13:16] And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river
[Book of Joshua 13:22] Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of
[Book of Joshua 13:23] And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the
[Book of Joshua 13:24] And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the
[Book of Joshua 13:25] And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and
[Book of Joshua 13:28] This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their
[Book of Joshua 13:29] And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and
[Book of Joshua 13:30] And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
[Book of Joshua 13:32] These are the countries which Moses did distribute for
[Book of Joshua 13:33] But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the
[Book of Joshua 14:1] And these are the countries which the children of Israel
[Book of Joshua 14:2] By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand
[Book of Joshua 14:3] For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half
[Book of Joshua 14:4] For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
[Book of Joshua 14:5] As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and
[Book of Joshua 14:6] Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb
[Book of Joshua 14:7] Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me
[Book of Joshua 14:8] Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of
[Book of Joshua 14:9] And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy
[Book of Joshua 14:10] And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these
[Book of Joshua 14:11] As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses
[Book of Joshua 14:12] Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in
[Book of Joshua 14:13] And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh
[Book of Joshua 14:14] Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
[Book of Joshua 14:15] And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a
[Book of Joshua 15:1] This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by
[Book of Joshua 15:2] And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from
[Book of Joshua 15:5] And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of
[Book of Joshua 15:9] And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the
[Book of Joshua 15:10] And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir,
[Book of Joshua 15:11] And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and
[Book of Joshua 15:12] And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof.
[Book of Joshua 15:13] And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the
[Book of Joshua 15:14] And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and
[Book of Joshua 15:15] And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name
[Book of Joshua 15:16] And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to
[Book of Joshua 15:17] And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and
[Book of Joshua 15:18] And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to
[Book of Joshua 15:20] This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
[Book of Joshua 15:21] And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
[Book of Joshua 15:22] And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah, 15:23 And Kedesh, and Hazor,
[Book of Joshua 15:28] And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah, 15:29 Baalah, and
[Book of Joshua 15:34] And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam, 15:35 Jarmuth, and
[Book of Joshua 15:57] Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages: 15:58
[Book of Joshua 15:63] As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children
[Book of Joshua 16:1] And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by
[Book of Joshua 16:3] And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast
[Book of Joshua 16:4] So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their
[Book of Joshua 16:5] And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their
[Book of Joshua 16:8] The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah;
[Book of Joshua 16:9] And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among
[Book of Joshua 16:10] And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but
[Book of Joshua 17:1] There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the
[Book of Joshua 17:2] There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by
[Book of Joshua 17:3] But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of
[Book of Joshua 17:4] And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua
[Book of Joshua 17:5] And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of
[Book of Joshua 17:7] And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that
[Book of Joshua 17:8] Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border
[Book of Joshua 17:11] And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her
[Book of Joshua 17:12] Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants
[Book of Joshua 17:13] Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen
[Book of Joshua 17:14] And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast
[Book of Joshua 17:16] And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us:
[Book of Joshua 17:17] And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
[Book of Joshua 18:1] And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled
[Book of Joshua 18:2] And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
[Book of Joshua 18:3] And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye
[Book of Joshua 18:5] And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in
[Book of Joshua 18:6] Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring
[Book of Joshua 18:7] But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the
[Book of Joshua 18:8] And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that
[Book of Joshua 18:9] And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by
[Book of Joshua 18:10] And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and
[Book of Joshua 18:11] And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
[Book of Joshua 18:12] And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the
[Book of Joshua 18:13] And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of
[Book of Joshua 18:14] And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the
[Book of Joshua 18:15] And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the
[Book of Joshua 18:17] And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and
[Book of Joshua 18:20] And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the
[Book of Joshua 18:21] Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
[Book of Joshua 19:1] And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of
[Book of Joshua 19:2] And they had in their inheritance Beersheba, and Sheba, and
[Book of Joshua 19:9] Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance
[Book of Joshua 19:10] And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according
[Book of Joshua 19:11] And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and
[Book of Joshua 19:15] And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and
[Book of Joshua 19:16] This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to
[Book of Joshua 19:17] And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of
[Book of Joshua 19:18] And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,
[Book of Joshua 19:19] And Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath, 19:20 And Rabbith, and
[Book of Joshua 19:23] This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar
[Book of Joshua 19:24] And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of
[Book of Joshua 19:25] And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,
[Book of Joshua 19:26] And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel
[Book of Joshua 19:31] This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher
[Book of Joshua 19:32] The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for the
[Book of Joshua 19:33] And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and
[Book of Joshua 19:35] And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and
[Book of Joshua 19:39] This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali
[Book of Joshua 19:40] And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of
[Book of Joshua 19:41] And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and
[Book of Joshua 19:47] And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for
[Book of Joshua 19:48] This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan
[Book of Joshua 19:49] When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance
[Book of Joshua 19:51] These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
[Book of Joshua 20:1] The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying, 20:2 Speak to the
[Book of Joshua 20:4] And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand
[Book of Joshua 20:5] And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not
[Book of Joshua 20:6] And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the
[Book of Joshua 20:7] And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and
[Book of Joshua 20:8] And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned
[Book of Joshua 20:9] These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel,
[Book of Joshua 21:1] Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto
[Book of Joshua 21:3] And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their
[Book of Joshua 21:4] And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the
[Book of Joshua 21:5] And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the
[Book of Joshua 21:6] And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the
[Book of Joshua 21:7] The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of
[Book of Joshua 21:8] And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these
[Book of Joshua 21:9] And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out
[Book of Joshua 21:10] Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the
[Book of Joshua 21:11] And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which
[Book of Joshua 21:12] But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they
[Book of Joshua 21:13] Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with
[Book of Joshua 21:16] And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and
[Book of Joshua 21:17] And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba
[Book of Joshua 21:19] All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were
[Book of Joshua 21:20] And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which
[Book of Joshua 21:21] For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, to
[Book of Joshua 21:23] And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon
[Book of Joshua 21:25] And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs,
[Book of Joshua 21:26] All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of
[Book of Joshua 21:27] And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the
[Book of Joshua 21:28] And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs,
[Book of Joshua 21:30] And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon
[Book of Joshua 21:32] And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her
[Book of Joshua 21:33] All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families
[Book of Joshua 21:34] And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the
[Book of Joshua 21:36] And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and
[Book of Joshua 21:38] And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs,
[Book of Joshua 21:39] Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in
[Book of Joshua 21:40] So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families,
[Book of Joshua 21:41] All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the
[Book of Joshua 21:42] These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them:
[Book of Joshua 21:43] And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to
[Book of Joshua 21:44] And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that
[Book of Joshua 21:45] There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had
[Book of Joshua 22:1] Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half
[Book of Joshua 22:4] And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as
[Book of Joshua 22:5] But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which
[Book of Joshua 22:6] So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto
[Book of Joshua 22:7] Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
[Book of Joshua 22:9] And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half
[Book of Joshua 22:10] And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the
[Book of Joshua 22:11] And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of
[Book of Joshua 22:12] And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole
[Book of Joshua 22:13] And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and
[Book of Joshua 22:15] And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children
[Book of Joshua 22:19] Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then
[Book of Joshua 22:20] Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed
[Book of Joshua 22:21] Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half
[Book of Joshua 22:26] Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not
[Book of Joshua 22:28] Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to
[Book of Joshua 22:29] God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this
[Book of Joshua 22:30] And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the
[Book of Joshua 22:31] And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the
[Book of Joshua 22:32] And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
[Book of Joshua 22:33] And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children
[Book of Joshua 22:34] And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the
[Book of Joshua 23:1] And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given
[Book of Joshua 23:2] And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for
[Book of Joshua 23:4] Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain,
[Book of Joshua 23:5] And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and
[Book of Joshua 23:6] Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is
[Book of Joshua 23:9] For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and
[Book of Joshua 23:10] One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he
[Book of Joshua 23:11] Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD
[Book of Joshua 23:12] Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant
[Book of Joshua 23:14] And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and
[Book of Joshua 23:15] Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are
[Book of Joshua 23:16] When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God,
[Book of Joshua 24:1] And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and
[Book of Joshua 24:2] And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of
[Book of Joshua 24:3] And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood,
[Book of Joshua 24:4] And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount
[Book of Joshua 24:5] I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to
[Book of Joshua 24:6] And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the
[Book of Joshua 24:7] And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you
[Book of Joshua 24:8] And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on
[Book of Joshua 24:9] Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred
[Book of Joshua 24:11] And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of
[Book of Joshua 24:12] And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from
[Book of Joshua 24:13] And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and
[Book of Joshua 24:14] Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in
[Book of Joshua 24:15] And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this
[Book of Joshua 24:16] And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should
[Book of Joshua 24:19] And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for
[Book of Joshua 24:20] If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will
[Book of Joshua 24:21] And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the
[Book of Joshua 24:22] And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against
[Book of Joshua 24:23] Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are
[Book of Joshua 24:24] And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve,
[Book of Joshua 24:25] So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them
[Book of Joshua 24:26] And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and
[Book of Joshua 24:27] And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be
[Book of Joshua 24:28] So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.
[Book of Joshua 24:29] And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of
[Book of Joshua 24:30] And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
[Book of Joshua 24:31] And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the
[Book of Joshua 24:32] And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up
[Book of Joshua 24:33] And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill
[Book of Judges 1:1] Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children
[Book of Judges 1:3] And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my
[Book of Judges 1:4] And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the
[Book of Judges 1:5] And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him,
[Book of Judges 1:6] But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him,
[Book of Judges 1:7] And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs
[Book of Judges 1:8] Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had
[Book of Judges 1:9] And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the
[Book of Judges 1:10] And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now
[Book of Judges 1:11] And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the
[Book of Judges 1:13] And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it:
[Book of Judges 1:14] And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to
[Book of Judges 1:16] And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father in law, went up out
[Book of Judges 1:17] And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the
[Book of Judges 1:18] Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the
[Book of Judges 1:19] And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of
[Book of Judges 1:20] And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled
[Book of Judges 1:21] And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that
[Book of Judges 1:22] And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and
[Book of Judges 1:23] And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of
[Book of Judges 1:25] And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote
[Book of Judges 1:26] And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city,
[Book of Judges 1:27] Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and
[Book of Judges 1:28] And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the
[Book of Judges 1:29] Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer;
[Book of Judges 1:30] Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the
[Book of Judges 1:31] Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
[Book of Judges 1:33] Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh,
[Book of Judges 1:34] And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain:
[Book of Judges 1:36] And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim,
[Book of Judges 2:1] And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said,
[Book of Judges 2:2] And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye
[Book of Judges 2:4] And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words
[Book of Judges 2:5] And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed
[Book of Judges 2:6] And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went
[Book of Judges 2:7] And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the
[Book of Judges 2:8] And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an
[Book of Judges 2:9] And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
[Book of Judges 2:10] And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers:
[Book of Judges 2:11] And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
[Book of Judges 2:13] And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
[Book of Judges 2:14] And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
[Book of Judges 2:15] Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against
[Book of Judges 2:16] Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out
[Book of Judges 2:17] And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a
[Book of Judges 2:18] And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with
[Book of Judges 2:19] And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned,
[Book of Judges 2:20] And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said,
[Book of Judges 2:23] Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out
[Book of Judges 3:1] Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by
[Book of Judges 3:2] Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to
[Book of Judges 3:4] And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would
[Book of Judges 3:5] And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites,
[Book of Judges 3:7] And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and
[Book of Judges 3:8] Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
[Book of Judges 3:9] And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
[Book of Judges 3:10] And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel,
[Book of Judges 3:11] And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz
[Book of Judges 3:12] And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
[Book of Judges 3:13] And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and
[Book of Judges 3:14] So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen
[Book of Judges 3:15] But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
[Book of Judges 3:16] But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit
[Book of Judges 3:17] And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was
[Book of Judges 3:18] And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away
[Book of Judges 3:19] But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by
[Book of Judges 3:20] And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour,
[Book of Judges 3:21] And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his
[Book of Judges 3:23] Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the
[Book of Judges 3:24] When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that,
[Book of Judges 3:25] And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened
[Book of Judges 3:26] And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the
[Book of Judges 3:27] And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in
[Book of Judges 3:28] And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath
[Book of Judges 3:29] And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all
[Book of Judges 3:30] So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the
[Book of Judges 3:31] And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the
[Book of Judges 4:1] And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the
[Book of Judges 4:2] And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that
[Book of Judges 4:3] And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine
[Book of Judges 4:4] And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel
[Book of Judges 4:5] And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and
[Book of Judges 4:6] And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
[Book of Judges 4:8] And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go:
[Book of Judges 4:9] And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the
[Book of Judges 4:10] And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up
[Book of Judges 4:11] Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the
[Book of Judges 4:12] And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up
[Book of Judges 4:13] And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred
[Book of Judges 4:14] And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the
[Book of Judges 4:15] And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all
[Book of Judges 4:16] But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto
[Book of Judges 4:17] Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife
[Book of Judges 4:18] And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my
[Book of Judges 4:19] And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to
[Book of Judges 4:20] Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it
[Book of Judges 4:21] Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an
[Book of Judges 4:22] And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him,
[Book of Judges 4:23] So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the
[Book of Judges 4:24] And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed
[Book of Judges 5:1] Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
[Book of Judges 5:3] Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing
[Book of Judges 5:4] LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of
[Book of Judges 5:5] The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from
[Book of Judges 5:6] In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the
[Book of Judges 5:7] The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel,
[Book of Judges 5:8] They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield
[Book of Judges 5:10] Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and
[Book of Judges 5:11] They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places
[Book of Judges 5:12] Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak,
[Book of Judges 5:13] Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles
[Book of Judges 5:14] Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after
[Book of Judges 5:15] And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and
[Book of Judges 5:16] Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of
[Book of Judges 5:17] Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?
[Book of Judges 5:18] Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives
[Book of Judges 5:19] The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in
[Book of Judges 5:20] They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought
[Book of Judges 5:21] The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the
[Book of Judges 5:22] Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings,
[Book of Judges 5:23] Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the
[Book of Judges 5:24] Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be,
[Book of Judges 5:25] He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter
[Book of Judges 5:26] She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen’s
[Book of Judges 5:27] At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed,
[Book of Judges 5:28] The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through
[Book of Judges 6:1] And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and
[Book of Judges 6:2] And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of
[Book of Judges 6:3] And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up,
[Book of Judges 6:5] For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came
[Book of Judges 6:6] And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and
[Book of Judges 6:7] And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the
[Book of Judges 6:11] And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which
[Book of Judges 6:12] And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:13] And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:14] And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:16] And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:17] And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:18] Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:19] And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:20] And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:21] Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:22] And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:23] And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:24] Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:25] And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:27] Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:28] And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:29] And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:30] Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:31] And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:32] Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:33] Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:34] But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:35] And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:36] And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:38] And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:39] And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 6:40] And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:1] Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:2] And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:3] Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:4] And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:5] So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:6] And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:7] And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:8] So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:9] And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:10] But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:12] And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:13] And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:14] And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:15] And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:16] And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:17] And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:18] When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:19] So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:20] And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:21] And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:22] And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:23] And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:24] And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 7:25] And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:1] And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:2] And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you?
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:4] And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:5] And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:6] And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:7] And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:8] And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:9] And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:10] Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:11] And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:12] And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:13] And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:15] And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:17] And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:18] Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:19] And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother:
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:20] And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:21] Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:22] Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:23] And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:24] And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:26] And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:27] And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:28] Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:29] And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:30] And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:31] And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:32] And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:33] And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 8:34] And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:1] And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:3] And his mother’s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:4] And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:5] And he went unto his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:6] And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:7] And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:8] The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:9] But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:11] But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:13] And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:15] And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:16] Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:21] And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:22] When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel, 9:23 Then God
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:25] And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:26] And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:27] And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:28] And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:30] And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:31] And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:32] Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:34] And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:35] And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:36] And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:37] And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:38] Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:39] And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:40] And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:41] And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:42] And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:43] And he took the people, and divided them into three companies,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:44] And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:45] And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:46] And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:47] And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:48] And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:49] And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:50] Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:51] But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:52] And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:53] And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech’s
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:54] Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:55] And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 9:56] Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:1] And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:2] And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:3] And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:4] And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:5] And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:6] And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:7] And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:8] And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel:
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:9] Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:10] And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:11] And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:13] Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:14] Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:15] And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned:
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:16] And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:17] Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 10:18] And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:1] Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:2] And Gilead’s wife bare him sons; and his wife’s sons grew up, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:3] Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:4] And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:5] And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:7] And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:9] And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:11] Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:12] And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:14] And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:16] But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:18] Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:19] And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:20] But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:21] And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:22] And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:23] So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:25] And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:28] Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:29] Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:30] And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:32] So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:33] And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:34] And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:35] And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:36] And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:37] And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:38] And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 11:39] And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 12:1] And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 12:2] And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 12:3] And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 12:5] And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 12:7] And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 12:8] And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 12:9] And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 12:10] Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 12:11] And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 12:12] And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 12:13] And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 12:14] And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 12:15] And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:1] And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:2] And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:3] And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:4] Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:6] Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:8] Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:9] And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:10] And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:11] And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:12] And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:14] She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:15] And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:16] And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:17] And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:20] For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:21] But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:22] And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:23] But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:24] And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13:25] And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:1] And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:2] And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:3] Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:4] But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:5] Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:6] And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:7] And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:8] And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:9] And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:10] So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:11] And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:12] And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:14] And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:15] And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:18] And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:19] And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 14:20] But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:1] But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:2] And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:3] And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:4] And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:5] And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:6] Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:7] And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:8] And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:9] Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:10] And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:11] Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:12] And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:13] And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:14] And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him:
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:15] And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:16] And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:17] And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:18] And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 15:20] And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:1] Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:2] And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:3] And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:4] And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:5] And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:6] And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:7] And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:8] Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:9] Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:10] And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:11] And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:12] Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:13] And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:14] And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:15] And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:16] And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:18] And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:19] And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:20] And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:21] But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:22] Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:23] Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:24] And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:25] And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:26] And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:27] Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:28] And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:29] And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:30] And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 16:31] Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 17:1] And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 17:2] And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 17:3] And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 17:4] Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 17:5] And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 17:6] In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 17:7] And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 17:8] And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 17:9] And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 17:10] And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 17:11] And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 17:12] And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 17:13] Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:1] In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:2] And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:3] When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:5] And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:6] And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:7] Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:8] And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:10] When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:11] And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:12] And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah:
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:13] And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:14] Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:15] And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:16] And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:17] And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:18] And these went into Micah’s house, and fetched the carved image,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:21] So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:22] And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:23] And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:26] And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:27] And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:28] And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:29] And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:30] And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 18:31] And they set them up Micah’s graven image, which he made, all
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:1] And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:2] And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:3] And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:4] And his father in law, the damsel’s father, retained him; and he
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:5] And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:6] And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together:
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:7] And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him:
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:8] And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:9] And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:10] But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:11] And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:12] And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:13] And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:14] And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:15] And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah:
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:16] And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:17] And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:19] Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:20] And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:21] So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:22] Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:23] And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:24] Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:25] But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:26] Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:27] And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:28] And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:29] And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 19:30] And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:1] Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:2] And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:3] (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:5] And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:6] And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:7] Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:8] And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:9] But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:11] So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:12] And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:13] Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:14] But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:15] And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:16] Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:17] And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:18] And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:19] And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:20] And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:21] And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:22] And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:23] (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:25] And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:26] Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:27] And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:29] And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:30] And the children of Israel went up against the children of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:31] And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:32] And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:33] And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:34] And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:35] And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:36] So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:37] And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:38] Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:39] And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:40] But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:41] And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:42] Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:43] Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:44] And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:45] And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:46] So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:47] But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 20:48] And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:1] Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:2] And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:5] And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:6] And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:7] How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:9] For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:10] And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:11] And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:12] And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:13] And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:14] And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:15] And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:16] Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:18] Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:19] Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:20] Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:22] And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:23] And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives,
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:24] And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every
[LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 21:25] In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that
[Book of Ruth 1:1] Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there
[Book of Ruth 1:2] And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife
[Book of Ruth 1:3] And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two
[Book of Ruth 1:4] And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one
[Book of Ruth 1:5] And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was
[Book of Ruth 1:6] Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return
[Book of Ruth 1:7] Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her
[Book of Ruth 1:8] And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to
[Book of Ruth 1:9] The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house
[Book of Ruth 1:10] And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy
[Book of Ruth 1:11] And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me?
[Book of Ruth 1:14] And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed
[Book of Ruth 1:15] And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her
[Book of Ruth 1:16] And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
[Book of Ruth 1:18] When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then
[Book of Ruth 1:19] So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to
[Book of Ruth 1:21] I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty:
[Book of Ruth 2:1] And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth,
[Book of Ruth 2:2] And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the
[Book of Ruth 2:3] And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the
[Book of Ruth 2:4] And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers,
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 2:5] Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers,
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 2:8] Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 2:10] Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 2:12] The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 2:13] Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 2:14] And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 2:15] And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men,
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 2:16] And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 2:17] So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 2:18] And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 2:19] And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 2:20] And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 2:21] And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 2:22] And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 2:23] So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:1] Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:3] Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:4] And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:5] And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:6] And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:7] And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:8] And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:9] And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:10] And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:11] And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:12] And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:13] Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:14] And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:15] Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:16] And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou,
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:17] And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 3:18] Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:1] Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and,
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:2] And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:3] And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:5] Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:6] And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:7] Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:8] Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:9] And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:10] Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:11] And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said,
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:12] And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:13] So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:14] And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:15] And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:16] And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:17] And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:18] Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,
[LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee. 4:19] And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab, 4:20 And Amminadab
[First Book of the Kings 1:1] Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim,
[First Book of the Kings 1:3] And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
[First Book of the Kings 1:4] And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah
[First Book of the Kings 1:6] And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret,
[First Book of the Kings 1:7] And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of
[First Book of the Kings 1:8] Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou?
[First Book of the Kings 1:10] And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and
[First Book of the Kings 1:11] And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt
[First Book of the Kings 1:12] And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD,
[First Book of the Kings 1:13] Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her
[First Book of the Kings 1:14] And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away
[First Book of the Kings 1:15] And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a
[First Book of the Kings 1:16] Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the
[First Book of the Kings 1:17] Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel
[First Book of the Kings 1:18] And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the
[First Book of the Kings 1:19] And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the
[First Book of the Kings 1:20] Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after
[First Book of the Kings 1:21] And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the
[First Book of the Kings 1:22] But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not
[First Book of the Kings 1:23] And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good;
[First Book of the Kings 1:24] And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three
[First Book of the Kings 1:25] And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
[First Book of the Kings 1:26] And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the
[First Book of the Kings 1:27] For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition
[First Book of the Kings 2:1] And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine
[First Book of the Kings 2:2] There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee:
[First Book of the Kings 2:3] Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of
[First Book of the Kings 2:4] The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are
[First Book of the Kings 2:5] They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they
[First Book of the Kings 2:6] The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave,
[First Book of the Kings 2:7] The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and
[First Book of the Kings 2:8] He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar
[First Book of the Kings 2:9] He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be
[First Book of the Kings 2:10] The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of
[First Book of the Kings 2:11] And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did
[First Book of the Kings 2:12] Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.
[First Book of the Kings 2:13] And the priest’s custom with the people was, that, when any man
[First Book of the Kings 2:15] Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and
[First Book of the Kings 2:16] And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat
[First Book of the Kings 2:17] Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the
[First Book of the Kings 2:18] But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with
[First Book of the Kings 2:19] Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him
[First Book of the Kings 2:20] And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give
[First Book of the Kings 2:21] And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare
[First Book of the Kings 2:22] Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all
[First Book of the Kings 2:23] And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your
[First Book of the Kings 2:24] Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the
[First Book of the Kings 2:25] If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if
[First Book of the Kings 2:26] And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the
[First Book of the Kings 2:27] And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus
[First Book of the Kings 2:31] Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm
[First Book of the Kings 2:32] And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth
[First Book of the Kings 2:33] And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar,
[First Book of the Kings 2:34] And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two
[First Book of the Kings 2:35] And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according
[First Book of the Kings 2:36] And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine
[First Book of the Kings 3:1] And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the
[First Book of the Kings 3:2] And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his
[First Book of the Kings 3:5] And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me.
[First Book of the Kings 3:6] And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went
[First Book of the Kings 3:7] Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the
[First Book of the Kings 3:8] And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and
[First Book of the Kings 3:9] Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if
[First Book of the Kings 3:10] And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times,
[First Book of the Kings 3:11] And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,
[First Book of the Kings 3:12] In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have
[First Book of the Kings 3:13] For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the
[First Book of the Kings 3:14] And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the
[First Book of the Kings 3:15] And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the
[First Book of the Kings 3:16] Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he
[First Book of the Kings 3:17] And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee?
[First Book of the Kings 3:18] And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he
[First Book of the Kings 3:19] And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of
[First Book of the Kings 3:20] And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
[First Book of the Kings 3:21] And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed
[First Book of the Kings 4:1] And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out
[First Book of the Kings 4:2] And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and
[First Book of the Kings 4:3] And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel
[First Book of the Kings 4:4] So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence
[First Book of the Kings 4:5] And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp,
[First Book of the Kings 4:6] And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said,
[First Book of the Kings 4:7] And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into
[First Book of the Kings 4:8] Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty
[First Book of the Kings 4:9] Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye
[First Book of the Kings 4:10] And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled
[First Book of the Kings 4:11] And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and
[First Book of the Kings 4:12] And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to
[First Book of the Kings 4:13] And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
[First Book of the Kings 4:14] And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth
[First Book of the Kings 4:15] Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim,
[First Book of the Kings 4:16] And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and
[First Book of the Kings 4:18] And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that
[First Book of the Kings 4:19] And his daughter in law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to
[First Book of the Kings 4:20] And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said
[First Book of the Kings 4:21] And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed
[First Book of the Kings 4:22] And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of
[First Book of the Kings 5:1] And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from
[First Book of the Kings 5:2] When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the
[First Book of the Kings 5:3] And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon
[First Book of the Kings 5:4] And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was
[First Book of the Kings 5:5] Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into
[First Book of the Kings 5:6] But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he
[First Book of the Kings 5:7] And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark
[First Book of the Kings 5:8] They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines
[First Book of the Kings 5:9] And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of
[First Book of the Kings 5:10] Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass,
[First Book of the Kings 5:11] So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the
[First Book of the Kings 5:12] And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the
[First Book of the Kings 6:1] And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines
[First Book of the Kings 6:2] And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
[First Book of the Kings 6:3] And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send
[First Book of the Kings 6:4] Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall
[First Book of the Kings 6:5] Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your
[First Book of the Kings 6:6] Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and
[First Book of the Kings 6:9] And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
[First Book of the Kings 6:10] And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the
[First Book of the Kings 6:12] And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and
[First Book of the Kings 6:13] And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the
[First Book of the Kings 6:14] And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and
[First Book of the Kings 6:15] And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer
[First Book of the Kings 6:16] And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they
[First Book of the Kings 6:17] And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned
[First Book of the Kings 6:19] And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into
[First Book of the Kings 6:20] And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this
[First Book of the Kings 7:1] And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the
[First Book of the Kings 7:2] And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that
[First Book of the Kings 7:3] And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do
[First Book of the Kings 7:4] Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and
[First Book of the Kings 7:5] And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for
[First Book of the Kings 7:6] And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured
[First Book of the Kings 7:7] And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were
[First Book of the Kings 7:8] And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto
[First Book of the Kings 7:9] And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt
[First Book of the Kings 7:10] And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines
[First Book of the Kings 7:11] And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
[First Book of the Kings 7:12] Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and
[First Book of the Kings 7:13] So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the
[First Book of the Kings 7:14] And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were
[First Book of the Kings 7:15] And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
[First Book of the Kings 7:16] And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal,
[First Book of the Kings 7:17] And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there
[First Book of the Kings 8:1] And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons
[First Book of the Kings 8:2] Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his
[First Book of the Kings 8:3] And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre,
[First Book of the Kings 8:4] Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and
[First Book of the Kings 8:6] But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to
[First Book of the Kings 8:7] And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the
[First Book of the Kings 8:8] According to all the works which they have done since the day that
[First Book of the Kings 8:9] Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest
[First Book of the Kings 8:10] And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that
[First Book of the Kings 8:11] And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign
[First Book of the Kings 8:12] And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains
[First Book of the Kings 8:13] And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be
[First Book of the Kings 8:14] And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
[First Book of the Kings 8:15] And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,
[First Book of the Kings 8:16] And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and
[First Book of the Kings 8:17] He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his
[First Book of the Kings 8:18] And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye
[First Book of the Kings 8:19] Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and
[First Book of the Kings 8:21] And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed
[First Book of the Kings 8:22] And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make
[First Book of the Kings 9:1] Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of
[First Book of the Kings 9:2] And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a
[First Book of the Kings 9:3] And the asses of Kish Saul’s father were lost. And Kish said to
[First Book of the Kings 9:4] And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land
[First Book of the Kings 9:5] And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his
[First Book of the Kings 9:6] And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of
[First Book of the Kings 9:7] Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall
[First Book of the Kings 9:9] (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he
[First Book of the Kings 9:11] And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young
[First Book of the Kings 9:12] And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before
[First Book of the Kings 9:14] And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the
[First Book of the Kings 9:15] Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came,
[First Book of the Kings 9:17] And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man
[First Book of the Kings 9:18] Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I
[First Book of the Kings 9:19] And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before
[First Book of the Kings 9:20] And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy
[First Book of the Kings 9:23] And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave
[First Book of the Kings 9:24] And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it,
[First Book of the Kings 9:25] And when they were come down from the high place into the city,
[First Book of the Kings 9:26] And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the
[First Book of the Kings 9:27] And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said
[First Book of the Kings 10:1] Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and
[First Book of the Kings 10:4] And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread;
[First Book of the Kings 10:5] After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the
[First Book of the Kings 10:7] And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do
[First Book of the Kings 10:8] And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will
[First Book of the Kings 10:9] And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from
[First Book of the Kings 10:10] And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of
[First Book of the Kings 10:11] And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that,
[First Book of the Kings 10:14] And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went
[First Book of the Kings 10:15] And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said
[First Book of the Kings 10:16] And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses
[First Book of the Kings 10:17] And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;
[First Book of the Kings 10:18] And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of
[First Book of the Kings 10:20] And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come
[First Book of the Kings 10:21] When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their
[First Book of the Kings 10:22] Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should
[First Book of the Kings 10:23] And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the
[First Book of the Kings 10:24] And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath
[First Book of the Kings 10:25] Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote
[First Book of the Kings 10:26] And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a
[First Book of the Kings 10:27] But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And
[First Book of the Kings 11:1] Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against
[First Book of the Kings 11:2] And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I
[First Book of the Kings 11:3] And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days’
[First Book of the Kings 11:4] Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings
[First Book of the Kings 11:5] And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul
[First Book of the Kings 11:6] And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings,
[First Book of the Kings 11:7] And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent
[First Book of the Kings 11:8] And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were
[First Book of the Kings 11:9] And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say
[First Book of the Kings 11:10] Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out
[First Book of the Kings 11:11] And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three
[First Book of the Kings 11:12] And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul
[First Book of the Kings 11:13] And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day:
[First Book of the Kings 11:14] Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,
[First Book of the Kings 11:15] And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king
[First Book of the Kings 12:1] And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto
[First Book of the Kings 12:2] And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and
[First Book of the Kings 12:3] Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before
[First Book of the Kings 12:4] And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,
[First Book of the Kings 12:5] And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his
[First Book of the Kings 12:6] And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced
[First Book of the Kings 12:7] Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the
[First Book of the Kings 12:8] When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the
[First Book of the Kings 12:9] And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the
[First Book of the Kings 12:10] And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because
[First Book of the Kings 12:11] And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and
[First Book of the Kings 12:12] And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon
[First Book of the Kings 12:13] Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye
[First Book of the Kings 12:14] If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and
[First Book of the Kings 12:16] Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD
[First Book of the Kings 12:17] Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and
[First Book of the Kings 12:18] So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and
[First Book of the Kings 12:19] And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto
[First Book of the Kings 12:20] And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this
[First Book of the Kings 12:22] For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name’s
[First Book of the Kings 12:23] Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the
[First Book of the Kings 12:25] But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye
[First Book of the Kings 13:1] Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over
[First Book of the Kings 13:3] And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in
[First Book of the Kings 13:4] And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the
[First Book of the Kings 13:5] And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with
[First Book of the Kings 13:6] When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the
[First Book of the Kings 13:7] And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and
[First Book of the Kings 13:8] And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel
[First Book of the Kings 13:9] And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace
[First Book of the Kings 13:10] And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of
[First Book of the Kings 13:11] And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I
[First Book of the Kings 13:13] And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not
[First Book of the Kings 13:14] But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him
[First Book of the Kings 13:15] And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of
[First Book of the Kings 13:16] And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present
[First Book of the Kings 13:17] And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in
[First Book of the Kings 13:19] Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel:
[First Book of the Kings 13:20] But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen
[First Book of the Kings 13:21] Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and
[First Book of the Kings 13:22] So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither
[First Book of the Kings 13:23] And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of
[First Book of the Kings 14:1] Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul
[First Book of the Kings 14:2] And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a
[First Book of the Kings 14:4] And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over
[First Book of the Kings 14:5] The forefront of the one was situate northward over against
[First Book of the Kings 14:6] And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come,
[First Book of the Kings 14:7] And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine
[First Book of the Kings 14:8] Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and
[First Book of the Kings 14:9] If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we
[First Book of the Kings 14:10] But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for
[First Book of the Kings 14:11] And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the
[First Book of the Kings 14:12] And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his
[First Book of the Kings 14:13] And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and
[First Book of the Kings 14:14] And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer
[First Book of the Kings 14:15] And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all
[First Book of the Kings 14:16] And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,
[First Book of the Kings 14:17] Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now,
[First Book of the Kings 14:18] And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the
[First Book of the Kings 14:19] And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the
[First Book of the Kings 14:20] And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled
[First Book of the Kings 14:21] Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that
[First Book of the Kings 14:22] Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount
[First Book of the Kings 14:23] So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over
[First Book of the Kings 14:24] And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had
[First Book of the Kings 14:25] And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey
[First Book of the Kings 14:26] And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey
[First Book of the Kings 14:27] But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with
[First Book of the Kings 14:28] Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly
[First Book of the Kings 14:29] Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I
[First Book of the Kings 14:30] How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of
[First Book of the Kings 14:32] And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
[First Book of the Kings 14:33] Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the
[First Book of the Kings 14:34] And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say
[First Book of the Kings 14:35] And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first
[First Book of the Kings 14:36] And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,
[First Book of the Kings 14:37] And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the
[First Book of the Kings 14:38] And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people:
[First Book of the Kings 14:39] For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in
[First Book of the Kings 14:40] Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and
[First Book of the Kings 14:41] Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect
[First Book of the Kings 14:42] And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And
[First Book of the Kings 14:43] Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And
[First Book of the Kings 14:44] And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt
[First Book of the Kings 14:45] And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath
[First Book of the Kings 14:46] Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the
[First Book of the Kings 14:47] So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his
[First Book of the Kings 14:48] And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered
[First Book of the Kings 14:49] Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua:
[First Book of the Kings 14:51] And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was
[First Book of the Kings 14:52] And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of
[First Book of the Kings 15:1] Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be
[First Book of the Kings 15:2] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to
[First Book of the Kings 15:3] Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have,
[First Book of the Kings 15:4] And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in
[First Book of the Kings 15:5] And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
[First Book of the Kings 15:6] And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from
[First Book of the Kings 15:7] And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to
[First Book of the Kings 15:8] And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
[First Book of the Kings 15:9] But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep,
[First Book of the Kings 15:10] Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying, 15:11 It
[First Book of the Kings 15:12] And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was
[First Book of the Kings 15:13] And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou
[First Book of the Kings 15:14] And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in
[First Book of the Kings 15:16] Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the
[First Book of the Kings 15:17] And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast
[First Book of the Kings 15:19] Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but
[First Book of the Kings 15:20] And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the
[First Book of the Kings 15:21] But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of
[First Book of the Kings 15:22] And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt
[First Book of the Kings 15:23] For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
[First Book of the Kings 15:24] And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have
[First Book of the Kings 15:25] Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with
[First Book of the Kings 15:26] And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou
[First Book of the Kings 15:27] And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the
[First Book of the Kings 15:28] And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of
[First Book of the Kings 15:29] And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he
[First Book of the Kings 15:30] Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee,
[First Book of the Kings 15:31] So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.
[First Book of the Kings 15:32] Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
[First Book of the Kings 15:33] And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so
[First Book of the Kings 15:34] Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to
[First Book of the Kings 15:35] And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death:
[First Book of the Kings 16:1] And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,
[First Book of the Kings 16:2] And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.
[First Book of the Kings 16:3] And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou
[First Book of the Kings 16:4] And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem.
[First Book of the Kings 16:6] And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on
[First Book of the Kings 16:7] But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on
[First Book of the Kings 16:8] Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And
[First Book of the Kings 16:9] Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the
[First Book of the Kings 16:10] Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And
[First Book of the Kings 16:11] And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he
[First Book of the Kings 16:12] And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of
[First Book of the Kings 16:13] Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst
[First Book of the Kings 16:14] But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil
[First Book of the Kings 16:15] And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit
[First Book of the Kings 16:16] Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to
[First Book of the Kings 16:17] And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can
[First Book of the Kings 16:18] Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen
[First Book of the Kings 16:19] Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me
[First Book of the Kings 16:20] And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine,
[First Book of the Kings 16:21] And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him
[First Book of the Kings 16:22] And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand
[First Book of the Kings 16:23] And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon
[First Book of the Kings 17:1] Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and
[First Book of the Kings 17:2] And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and
[First Book of the Kings 17:3] And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and
[First Book of the Kings 17:4] And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,
[First Book of the Kings 17:5] And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed
[First Book of the Kings 17:6] And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass
[First Book of the Kings 17:7] And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his
[First Book of the Kings 17:8] And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto
[First Book of the Kings 17:9] If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be
[First Book of the Kings 17:10] And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;
[First Book of the Kings 17:11] When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
[First Book of the Kings 17:12] Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah,
[First Book of the Kings 17:13] And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the
[First Book of the Kings 17:14] And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
[First Book of the Kings 17:15] But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep
[First Book of the Kings 17:16] And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented
[First Book of the Kings 17:17] And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an
[First Book of the Kings 17:19] Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the
[First Book of the Kings 17:20] And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with
[First Book of the Kings 17:21] For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army
[First Book of the Kings 17:22] And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
[First Book of the Kings 17:23] And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion,
[First Book of the Kings 17:24] And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him,
[First Book of the Kings 17:25] And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come
[First Book of the Kings 17:26] And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall
[First Book of the Kings 17:28] And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men;
[First Book of the Kings 17:29] And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
[First Book of the Kings 17:30] And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same
[First Book of the Kings 17:31] And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed
[First Book of the Kings 17:32] And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him;
[First Book of the Kings 17:33] And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
[First Book of the Kings 17:34] And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep,
[First Book of the Kings 17:35] And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of
[First Book of the Kings 17:36] Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this
[First Book of the Kings 17:37] David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw
[First Book of the Kings 17:38] And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of
[First Book of the Kings 17:39] And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to
[First Book of the Kings 17:40] And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth
[First Book of the Kings 17:41] And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man
[First Book of the Kings 17:42] And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he
[First Book of the Kings 17:43] And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest
[First Book of the Kings 17:44] And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give
[First Book of the Kings 17:45] Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a
[First Book of the Kings 17:46] This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will
[First Book of the Kings 17:47] And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with
[First Book of the Kings 17:48] And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and
[First Book of the Kings 17:49] And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and
[First Book of the Kings 17:50] So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a
[First Book of the Kings 17:51] Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his
[First Book of the Kings 17:52] And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and
[First Book of the Kings 17:53] And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
[First Book of the Kings 17:54] And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
[First Book of the Kings 17:55] And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said
[First Book of the Kings 17:56] And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.
[First Book of the Kings 17:57] And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,
[First Book of the Kings 17:58] And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And
[First Book of the Kings 18:1] And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
[First Book of the Kings 18:2] And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to
[First Book of the Kings 18:3] Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as
[First Book of the Kings 18:4] And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and
[First Book of the Kings 18:5] And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved
[First Book of the Kings 18:6] And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from
[First Book of the Kings 18:7] And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul
[First Book of the Kings 18:8] And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he
[First Book of the Kings 18:9] And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
[First Book of the Kings 18:10] And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God
[First Book of the Kings 18:11] And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even
[First Book of the Kings 18:12] And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and
[First Book of the Kings 18:13] Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain
[First Book of the Kings 18:14] And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD
[First Book of the Kings 18:15] Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he
[First Book of the Kings 18:16] But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and
[First Book of the Kings 18:17] And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will
[First Book of the Kings 18:18] And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my
[First Book of the Kings 18:19] But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul’s daughter
[First Book of the Kings 18:20] And Michal Saul’s daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and
[First Book of the Kings 18:21] And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to
[First Book of the Kings 18:22] And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David
[First Book of the Kings 18:23] And Saul’s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And
[First Book of the Kings 18:25] And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not
[First Book of the Kings 18:26] And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David
[First Book of the Kings 18:27] Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the
[First Book of the Kings 18:28] And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that
[First Book of the Kings 18:29] And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became
[First Book of the Kings 18:30] Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to
[First Book of the Kings 19:1] And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that
[First Book of the Kings 19:2] But Jonathan Saul’s son delighted much in David: and Jonathan
[First Book of the Kings 19:4] And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said
[First Book of the Kings 19:7] And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those
[First Book of the Kings 19:8] And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the
[First Book of the Kings 19:9] And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his
[First Book of the Kings 19:10] And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the
[First Book of the Kings 19:11] Saul also sent messengers unto David’s house, to watch him, and
[First Book of the Kings 19:12] So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and
[First Book of the Kings 19:13] And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a
[First Book of the Kings 19:14] And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is
[First Book of the Kings 19:15] And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring
[First Book of the Kings 19:16] And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image
[First Book of the Kings 19:17] And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and
[First Book of the Kings 19:19] And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in
[First Book of the Kings 19:20] And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the
[First Book of the Kings 19:21] And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
[First Book of the Kings 19:22] Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in
[First Book of the Kings 19:23] And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God
[First Book of the Kings 19:24] And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before
[First Book of the Kings 20:3] And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth
[First Book of the Kings 20:4] Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I
[First Book of the Kings 20:5] And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon,
[First Book of the Kings 20:6] If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked
[First Book of the Kings 20:7] If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if
[First Book of the Kings 20:8] Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast
[First Book of the Kings 20:12] And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have
[First Book of the Kings 20:14] And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of
[First Book of the Kings 20:16] So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let
[First Book of the Kings 20:17] And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him:
[First Book of the Kings 20:18] Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou
[First Book of the Kings 20:19] And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down
[First Book of the Kings 20:20] And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I
[First Book of the Kings 20:21] And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows.
[First Book of the Kings 20:22] But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are
[First Book of the Kings 20:23] And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,
[First Book of the Kings 20:24] So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was
[First Book of the Kings 20:25] And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a
[First Book of the Kings 20:26] Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought,
[First Book of the Kings 20:27] And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of
[First Book of the Kings 20:30] Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto
[First Book of the Kings 20:32] And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,
[First Book of the Kings 20:34] So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no
[First Book of the Kings 20:35] And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into
[First Book of the Kings 20:36] And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I
[First Book of the Kings 20:37] And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which
[First Book of the Kings 20:39] But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the
[First Book of the Kings 20:40] And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him,
[First Book of the Kings 20:41] And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place
[First Book of the Kings 20:42] And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have
[First Book of the Kings 21:1] Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was
[First Book of the Kings 21:3] Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of
[First Book of the Kings 21:4] And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread
[First Book of the Kings 21:5] And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth
[First Book of the Kings 21:6] So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread
[First Book of the Kings 21:7] Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
[First Book of the Kings 21:8] And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine
[First Book of the Kings 21:9] And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom
[First Book of the Kings 21:10] And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to
[First Book of the Kings 21:11] And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the
[First Book of the Kings 21:12] And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid
[First Book of the Kings 21:13] And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself
[First Book of the Kings 21:14] Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:
[First Book of the Kings 22:2] And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in
[First Book of the Kings 22:3] And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the
[First Book of the Kings 22:4] And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with
[First Book of the Kings 22:5] And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;
[First Book of the Kings 22:6] When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were
[First Book of the Kings 22:10] And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and
[First Book of the Kings 22:11] Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of
[First Book of the Kings 22:12] And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered,
[First Book of the Kings 22:13] And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou
[First Book of the Kings 22:16] And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and
[First Book of the Kings 22:17] And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn,
[First Book of the Kings 22:18] And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.
[First Book of the Kings 22:19] And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the
[First Book of the Kings 22:20] And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named
[First Book of the Kings 22:21] And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD’s
[First Book of the Kings 22:22] And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the
[First Book of the Kings 22:23] Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life
[First Book of the Kings 23:1] Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight
[First Book of the Kings 23:2] Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and
[First Book of the Kings 23:3] And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in
[First Book of the Kings 23:5] So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the
[First Book of the Kings 23:6] And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to
[First Book of the Kings 23:7] And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul
[First Book of the Kings 23:8] And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to
[First Book of the Kings 23:9] And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him;
[First Book of the Kings 23:10] Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath
[First Book of the Kings 23:11] Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul
[First Book of the Kings 23:12] Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men
[First Book of the Kings 23:13] Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and
[First Book of the Kings 23:14] And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained
[First Book of the Kings 23:15] And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David
[First Book of the Kings 23:16] And Jonathan Saul’s son arose, and went to David into the wood,
[First Book of the Kings 23:17] And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father
[First Book of the Kings 23:18] And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in
[First Book of the Kings 23:19] Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
[First Book of the Kings 23:21] And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion
[First Book of the Kings 23:22] Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where
[First Book of the Kings 23:23] See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places
[First Book of the Kings 23:24] And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his
[First Book of the Kings 23:25] Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David;
[First Book of the Kings 23:26] And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his
[First Book of the Kings 23:27] But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and
[First Book of the Kings 23:28] Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went
[First Book of the Kings 23:29] And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at
[First Book of the Kings 24:1] And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
[First Book of the Kings 24:2] Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and
[First Book of the Kings 24:3] And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and
[First Book of the Kings 24:4] And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the
[First Book of the Kings 24:5] And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him,
[First Book of the Kings 24:6] And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this
[First Book of the Kings 24:7] So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them
[First Book of the Kings 24:8] David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried
[First Book of the Kings 24:9] And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men’s words,
[First Book of the Kings 24:11] Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my
[First Book of the Kings 24:12] The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of
[First Book of the Kings 24:13] As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from
[First Book of the Kings 24:14] After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou
[First Book of the Kings 24:15] The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and
[First Book of the Kings 24:16] And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking
[First Book of the Kings 24:17] And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou
[First Book of the Kings 24:18] And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with
[First Book of the Kings 24:19] For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?
[First Book of the Kings 24:20] And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and
[First Book of the Kings 24:21] Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut
[First Book of the Kings 24:22] And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his
[First Book of the Kings 25:1] And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together,
[First Book of the Kings 25:2] And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;
[First Book of the Kings 25:3] Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife
[First Book of the Kings 25:4] And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.
[First Book of the Kings 25:5] And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young
[First Book of the Kings 25:6] And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be
[First Book of the Kings 25:7] And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds
[First Book of the Kings 25:8] Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the
[First Book of the Kings 25:9] And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to
[First Book of the Kings 25:10] And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and
[First Book of the Kings 25:11] Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I
[First Book of the Kings 25:13] And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And
[First Book of the Kings 25:14] But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying,
[First Book of the Kings 25:15] But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt,
[First Book of the Kings 25:17] Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is
[First Book of the Kings 25:18] Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two
[First Book of the Kings 25:19] And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come
[First Book of the Kings 25:20] And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the
[First Book of the Kings 25:21] Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
[First Book of the Kings 25:22] So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of
[First Book of the Kings 25:23] And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass,
[First Book of the Kings 25:24] And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let
[First Book of the Kings 25:25] Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even
[First Book of the Kings 25:26] Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul
[First Book of the Kings 25:27] And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my
[First Book of the Kings 25:28] I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the
[First Book of the Kings 25:29] Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the
[First Book of the Kings 25:30] And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my
[First Book of the Kings 25:32] And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,
[First Book of the Kings 25:34] For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath
[First Book of the Kings 25:35] So David received of her hand that which she had brought him,
[First Book of the Kings 25:36] And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his
[First Book of the Kings 25:37] But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out
[First Book of the Kings 25:38] And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote
[First Book of the Kings 25:39] And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be
[First Book of the Kings 25:40] And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,
[First Book of the Kings 25:41] And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and
[First Book of the Kings 25:42] And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five
[First Book of the Kings 25:43] David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of
[First Book of the Kings 25:44] But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Phalti
[First Book of the Kings 26:1] And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David
[First Book of the Kings 26:3] And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
[First Book of the Kings 26:4] David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come
[First Book of the Kings 26:5] And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched:
[First Book of the Kings 26:6] Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to
[First Book of the Kings 26:7] So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold,
[First Book of the Kings 26:8] Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into
[First Book of the Kings 26:9] And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch
[First Book of the Kings 26:11] The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against
[First Book of the Kings 26:12] So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s
[First Book of the Kings 26:13] Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of
[First Book of the Kings 26:16] This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth,
[First Book of the Kings 26:17] And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son
[First Book of the Kings 26:18] And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his
[First Book of the Kings 26:20] Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the
[First Book of the Kings 26:21] Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will
[First Book of the Kings 26:22] And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let
[First Book of the Kings 26:23] The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his
[First Book of the Kings 26:24] And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes,
[First Book of the Kings 26:25] Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou
[First Book of the Kings 27:1] And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the
[First Book of the Kings 27:2] And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that
[First Book of the Kings 27:3] And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man
[First Book of the Kings 27:4] And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought
[First Book of the Kings 27:5] And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine
[First Book of the Kings 27:7] And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines
[First Book of the Kings 27:8] And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and
[First Book of the Kings 27:9] And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive,
[First Book of the Kings 27:10] And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David
[First Book of the Kings 27:11] And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to
[First Book of the Kings 27:12] And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people
[First Book of the Kings 28:1] And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered
[First Book of the Kings 28:2] And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant
[First Book of the Kings 28:3] Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried
[First Book of the Kings 28:4] And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and
[First Book of the Kings 28:5] And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and
[First Book of the Kings 28:6] And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not,
[First Book of the Kings 28:7] Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a
[First Book of the Kings 28:8] And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he
[First Book of the Kings 28:9] And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath
[First Book of the Kings 28:11] Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he
[First Book of the Kings 28:12] And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and
[First Book of the Kings 28:13] And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou?
[First Book of the Kings 28:14] And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old
[First Book of the Kings 28:15] And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring
[First Book of the Kings 28:16] Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the
[First Book of the Kings 28:19] Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the
[First Book of the Kings 28:20] Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore
[First Book of the Kings 28:21] And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled,
[First Book of the Kings 28:22] Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of
[First Book of the Kings 28:23] But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants,
[First Book of the Kings 28:24] And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and
[First Book of the Kings 29:1] Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek:
[First Book of the Kings 29:2] And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by
[First Book of the Kings 29:3] Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews
[First Book of the Kings 29:7] Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not
[First Book of the Kings 29:8] And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast
[First Book of the Kings 29:9] And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good
[First Book of the Kings 29:10] Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master’s
[First Book of the Kings 29:11] So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to
[First Book of the Kings 30:1] And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag
[First Book of the Kings 30:3] So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned
[First Book of the Kings 30:4] Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their
[First Book of the Kings 30:5] And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the
[First Book of the Kings 30:6] And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning
[First Book of the Kings 30:7] And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, I pray
[First Book of the Kings 30:8] And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this
[First Book of the Kings 30:9] So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and
[First Book of the Kings 30:10] But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred
[First Book of the Kings 30:11] And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to
[First Book of the Kings 30:13] And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art
[First Book of the Kings 30:14] We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon
[First Book of the Kings 30:15] And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company?
[First Book of the Kings 30:16] And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread
[First Book of the Kings 30:17] And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of
[First Book of the Kings 30:18] And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away:
[First Book of the Kings 30:19] And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great,
[First Book of the Kings 30:20] And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave
[First Book of the Kings 30:21] And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that
[First Book of the Kings 30:22] Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those
[First Book of the Kings 30:23] Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that
[First Book of the Kings 30:24] For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is
[First Book of the Kings 30:25] And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute
[First Book of the Kings 30:26] And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the
[First Book of the Kings 30:30] And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in
[First Book of the Kings 31:1] Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel
[First Book of the Kings 31:2] And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;
[First Book of the Kings 31:3] And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him;
[First Book of the Kings 31:4] Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust
[First Book of the Kings 31:5] And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
[First Book of the Kings 31:6] So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all
[First Book of the Kings 31:7] And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the
[First Book of the Kings 31:8] And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to
[First Book of the Kings 31:9] And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent
[First Book of the Kings 31:10] And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they
[First Book of the Kings 31:11] And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the
[First Book of the Kings 31:13] And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at
[Second Book of the Kings 1:1] Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was
[Second Book of the Kings 1:3] And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto
[Second Book of the Kings 1:4] And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell
[Second Book of the Kings 1:5] And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou
[Second Book of the Kings 1:7] And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And
[Second Book of the Kings 1:8] And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an
[Second Book of the Kings 1:9] He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me:
[Second Book of the Kings 1:10] So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he
[Second Book of the Kings 1:11] Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise
[Second Book of the Kings 1:13] And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou?
[Second Book of the Kings 1:14] And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch
[Second Book of the Kings 1:16] And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy
[Second Book of the Kings 1:17] And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
[Second Book of the Kings 1:19] The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the
[Second Book of the Kings 1:21] Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be
[Second Book of the Kings 1:22] From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow
[Second Book of the Kings 1:23] Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in
[Second Book of the Kings 1:24] Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
[Second Book of the Kings 1:25] How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan,
[Second Book of the Kings 1:26] I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast
[Second Book of the Kings 1:27] How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished! 2:1
[Second Book of the Kings 2:2] So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the
[Second Book of the Kings 2:3] And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with
[Second Book of the Kings 2:4] And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over
[Second Book of the Kings 2:5] And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said
[Second Book of the Kings 2:6] And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will
[Second Book of the Kings 2:7] Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant:
[Second Book of the Kings 2:8] But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, took Ishbosheth
[Second Book of the Kings 2:10] Ishbosheth Saul’s son was forty years old when he began to reign
[Second Book of the Kings 2:11] And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of
[Second Book of the Kings 2:12] And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son
[Second Book of the Kings 2:13] And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out,
[Second Book of the Kings 2:14] And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play
[Second Book of the Kings 2:15] Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin,
[Second Book of the Kings 2:16] And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his
[Second Book of the Kings 2:17] And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten,
[Second Book of the Kings 2:18] And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,
[Second Book of the Kings 2:19] And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the
[Second Book of the Kings 2:20] Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he
[Second Book of the Kings 2:21] And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to
[Second Book of the Kings 2:22] And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following
[Second Book of the Kings 2:24] Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down
[Second Book of the Kings 2:25] And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after
[Second Book of the Kings 2:26] Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for
[Second Book of the Kings 2:28] So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and
[Second Book of the Kings 2:29] And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,
[Second Book of the Kings 2:30] And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered
[Second Book of the Kings 2:31] But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner’s
[Second Book of the Kings 2:32] And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his
[Second Book of the Kings 3:1] Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of
[Second Book of the Kings 3:2] And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was
[Second Book of the Kings 3:6] And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul
[Second Book of the Kings 3:7] And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of
[Second Book of the Kings 3:11] And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared
[Second Book of the Kings 3:12] And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose
[Second Book of the Kings 3:13] And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing
[Second Book of the Kings 3:14] And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul’s son, saying,
[Second Book of the Kings 3:15] And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
[Second Book of the Kings 3:16] And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to
[Second Book of the Kings 3:17] And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye
[Second Book of the Kings 3:19] And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also
[Second Book of the Kings 3:20] So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And
[Second Book of the Kings 3:21] And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather
[Second Book of the Kings 3:22] And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a
[Second Book of the Kings 3:23] When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told
[Second Book of the Kings 3:24] Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?
[Second Book of the Kings 3:26] And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after
[Second Book of the Kings 3:27] And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the
[Second Book of the Kings 3:28] And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are
[Second Book of the Kings 3:30] So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain
[Second Book of the Kings 3:31] And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him,
[Second Book of the Kings 3:32] And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his
[Second Book of the Kings 3:33] And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool
[Second Book of the Kings 3:35] And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it
[Second Book of the Kings 3:36] And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as
[Second Book of the Kings 3:37] For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was
[Second Book of the Kings 3:38] And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a
[Second Book of the Kings 4:1] And when Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands
[Second Book of the Kings 4:2] And Saul’s son had two men that were captains of bands: the name
[Second Book of the Kings 4:3] And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there
[Second Book of the Kings 4:5] And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went,
[Second Book of the Kings 4:6] And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they
[Second Book of the Kings 4:7] For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his
[Second Book of the Kings 4:8] And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and
[Second Book of the Kings 4:9] And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of
[Second Book of the Kings 5:1] Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and
[Second Book of the Kings 5:2] Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that
[Second Book of the Kings 5:3] So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king
[Second Book of the Kings 5:4] David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
[Second Book of the Kings 5:5] In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in
[Second Book of the Kings 5:6] And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the
[Second Book of the Kings 5:7] Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the
[Second Book of the Kings 5:8] And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter,
[Second Book of the Kings 5:9] So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And
[Second Book of the Kings 5:10] And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was
[Second Book of the Kings 5:11] And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees,
[Second Book of the Kings 5:12] And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over
[Second Book of the Kings 5:13] And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
[Second Book of the Kings 5:14] And these be the names of those that were born unto him in
[Second Book of the Kings 5:17] But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king
[Second Book of the Kings 5:18] The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of
[Second Book of the Kings 5:19] And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the
[Second Book of the Kings 5:20] And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and
[Second Book of the Kings 5:21] And there they left their images, and David and his men burned
[Second Book of the Kings 5:22] And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in
[Second Book of the Kings 5:23] And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go
[Second Book of the Kings 5:24] And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops
[Second Book of the Kings 5:25] And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the
[Second Book of the Kings 6:1] Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,
[Second Book of the Kings 6:2] And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him
[Second Book of the Kings 6:3] And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of
[Second Book of the Kings 6:4] And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at
[Second Book of the Kings 6:5] And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on
[Second Book of the Kings 6:6] And when they came to Nachon’s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his
[Second Book of the Kings 6:7] And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote
[Second Book of the Kings 6:8] And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon
[Second Book of the Kings 6:9] And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the
[Second Book of the Kings 6:11] And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the
[Second Book of the Kings 6:12] And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the
[Second Book of the Kings 6:13] And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had
[Second Book of the Kings 6:14] And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David
[Second Book of the Kings 6:15] So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the
[Second Book of the Kings 6:16] And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal
[Second Book of the Kings 6:17] And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place,
[Second Book of the Kings 6:18] And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings
[Second Book of the Kings 6:19] And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude
[Second Book of the Kings 6:20] Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the
[Second Book of the Kings 6:22] And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine
[Second Book of the Kings 6:23] Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day
[Second Book of the Kings 7:1] And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD
[Second Book of the Kings 7:3] And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart;
[Second Book of the Kings 7:4] And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came
[Second Book of the Kings 7:7] In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of
[Second Book of the Kings 7:10] Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will
[Second Book of the Kings 7:12] And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy
[Second Book of the Kings 7:13] He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the
[Second Book of the Kings 7:14] I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit
[Second Book of the Kings 7:16] And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
[Second Book of the Kings 7:17] According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
[Second Book of the Kings 7:18] Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,
[Second Book of the Kings 7:21] For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou
[Second Book of the Kings 7:22] Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like
[Second Book of the Kings 7:23] And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like
[Second Book of the Kings 7:25] And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning
[Second Book of the Kings 7:26] And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts
[Second Book of the Kings 7:27] For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy
[Second Book of the Kings 7:28] And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,
[Second Book of the Kings 8:1] And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines,
[Second Book of the Kings 8:2] And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them
[Second Book of the Kings 8:3] David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he
[Second Book of the Kings 8:4] And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred
[Second Book of the Kings 8:5] And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of
[Second Book of the Kings 8:6] Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians
[Second Book of the Kings 8:7] And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
[Second Book of the Kings 8:8] And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David
[Second Book of the Kings 8:9] When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host
[Second Book of the Kings 8:11] Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver
[Second Book of the Kings 8:13] And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the
[Second Book of the Kings 8:14] And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he
[Second Book of the Kings 8:15] And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment
[Second Book of the Kings 8:16] And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
[Second Book of the Kings 9:1] And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of
[Second Book of the Kings 9:3] And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that
[Second Book of the Kings 9:4] And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the
[Second Book of the Kings 9:5] Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir,
[Second Book of the Kings 9:6] Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was
[Second Book of the Kings 9:8] And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou
[Second Book of the Kings 9:10] Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the
[Second Book of the Kings 9:11] Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the
[Second Book of the Kings 9:12] And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all
[Second Book of the Kings 9:13] So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at
[Second Book of the Kings 10:1] And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of
[Second Book of the Kings 10:2] Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
[Second Book of the Kings 10:3] And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their
[Second Book of the Kings 10:4] Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one
[Second Book of the Kings 10:5] When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the
[Second Book of the Kings 10:6] And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David,
[Second Book of the Kings 10:7] And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the
[Second Book of the Kings 10:8] And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
[Second Book of the Kings 10:9] When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before
[Second Book of the Kings 10:11] And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
[Second Book of the Kings 10:12] Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and
[Second Book of the Kings 10:13] And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the
[Second Book of the Kings 10:14] And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
[Second Book of the Kings 10:15] And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,
[Second Book of the Kings 10:16] And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond
[Second Book of the Kings 10:17] And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and
[Second Book of the Kings 10:18] And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of
[Second Book of the Kings 10:19] And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that
[Second Book of the Kings 11:1] And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when
[Second Book of the Kings 11:2] And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off
[Second Book of the Kings 11:3] And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not
[Second Book of the Kings 11:4] And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto
[Second Book of the Kings 11:5] And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am
[Second Book of the Kings 11:6] And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And
[Second Book of the Kings 11:7] And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab
[Second Book of the Kings 11:8] And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.
[Second Book of the Kings 11:9] But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the
[Second Book of the Kings 11:10] And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto
[Second Book of the Kings 11:12] And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I
[Second Book of the Kings 11:13] And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him;
[Second Book of the Kings 11:14] And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to
[Second Book of the Kings 11:15] And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the
[Second Book of the Kings 11:16] And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he
[Second Book of the Kings 11:17] And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and
[Second Book of the Kings 11:18] Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
[Second Book of the Kings 11:19] And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of
[Second Book of the Kings 11:22] So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab
[Second Book of the Kings 11:23] And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed
[Second Book of the Kings 11:24] And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and
[Second Book of the Kings 11:25] Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto
[Second Book of the Kings 11:26] And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was
[Second Book of the Kings 11:27] And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to
[Second Book of the Kings 12:1] And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and
[Second Book of the Kings 12:2] The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds: 12:3 But the
[Second Book of the Kings 12:4] And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to
[Second Book of the Kings 12:5] And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he
[Second Book of the Kings 12:7] And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD
[Second Book of the Kings 12:9] Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do
[Second Book of the Kings 12:10] Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;
[Second Book of the Kings 12:11] Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee
[Second Book of the Kings 12:12] For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all
[Second Book of the Kings 12:13] And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And
[Second Book of the Kings 12:14] Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to
[Second Book of the Kings 12:15] And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the
[Second Book of the Kings 12:16] David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,
[Second Book of the Kings 12:17] And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him
[Second Book of the Kings 12:18] And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And
[Second Book of the Kings 12:20] Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed
[Second Book of the Kings 12:21] Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou
[Second Book of the Kings 12:22] And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
[Second Book of the Kings 12:24] And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,
[Second Book of the Kings 12:25] And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his
[Second Book of the Kings 12:26] And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and
[Second Book of the Kings 12:27] And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought
[Second Book of the Kings 12:28] Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp
[Second Book of the Kings 12:29] And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah,
[Second Book of the Kings 12:30] And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight
[Second Book of the Kings 12:31] And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them
[Second Book of the Kings 13:1] And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had
[Second Book of the Kings 13:2] And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar;
[Second Book of the Kings 13:3] But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of
[Second Book of the Kings 13:4] And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king’s son, lean
[Second Book of the Kings 13:5] And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make
[Second Book of the Kings 13:6] So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was
[Second Book of the Kings 13:7] Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother
[Second Book of the Kings 13:8] So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down.
[Second Book of the Kings 13:9] And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he
[Second Book of the Kings 13:10] And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that
[Second Book of the Kings 13:11] And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of
[Second Book of the Kings 13:12] And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no
[Second Book of the Kings 13:13] And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee,
[Second Book of the Kings 13:14] Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger
[Second Book of the Kings 13:15] Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith
[Second Book of the Kings 13:16] And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending
[Second Book of the Kings 13:17] Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said,
[Second Book of the Kings 13:18] And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such
[Second Book of the Kings 13:19] And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers
[Second Book of the Kings 13:20] And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother
[Second Book of the Kings 13:21] But when king David heard of all these things, he was very
[Second Book of the Kings 13:22] And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad:
[Second Book of the Kings 13:23] And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had
[Second Book of the Kings 13:24] And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant
[Second Book of the Kings 13:25] And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now
[Second Book of the Kings 13:26] Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go
[Second Book of the Kings 13:27] But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king’s
[Second Book of the Kings 13:28] Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when
[Second Book of the Kings 13:29] And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had
[Second Book of the Kings 13:30] And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings
[Second Book of the Kings 13:31] Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the
[Second Book of the Kings 13:32] And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and
[Second Book of the Kings 13:33] Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his
[Second Book of the Kings 13:34] But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted
[Second Book of the Kings 13:35] And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as
[Second Book of the Kings 13:36] And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking,
[Second Book of the Kings 13:37] But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king
[Second Book of the Kings 13:38] So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
[Second Book of the Kings 13:39] And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for
[Second Book of the Kings 14:1] Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was
[Second Book of the Kings 14:2] And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and
[Second Book of the Kings 14:4] And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her
[Second Book of the Kings 14:5] And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I
[Second Book of the Kings 14:6] And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in
[Second Book of the Kings 14:7] And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,
[Second Book of the Kings 14:8] And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will
[Second Book of the Kings 14:9] And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the
[Second Book of the Kings 14:10] And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to
[Second Book of the Kings 14:11] Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy
[Second Book of the Kings 14:12] Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one
[Second Book of the Kings 14:13] And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a
[Second Book of the Kings 14:14] For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground,
[Second Book of the Kings 14:15] Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord
[Second Book of the Kings 14:16] For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand
[Second Book of the Kings 14:17] Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now
[Second Book of the Kings 14:18] Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from
[Second Book of the Kings 14:19] And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all
[Second Book of the Kings 14:21] And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing:
[Second Book of the Kings 14:22] And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and
[Second Book of the Kings 14:23] So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to
[Second Book of the Kings 14:24] And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him
[Second Book of the Kings 14:25] But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as
[Second Book of the Kings 14:26] And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year’s end
[Second Book of the Kings 14:27] And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,
[Second Book of the Kings 14:28] So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the
[Second Book of the Kings 14:29] Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;
[Second Book of the Kings 14:30] Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near
[Second Book of the Kings 14:31] Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said
[Second Book of the Kings 14:33] So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called
[Second Book of the Kings 15:1] And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him
[Second Book of the Kings 15:2] And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate:
[Second Book of the Kings 15:3] And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right;
[Second Book of the Kings 15:4] Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
[Second Book of the Kings 15:6] And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the
[Second Book of the Kings 15:7] And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the
[Second Book of the Kings 15:8] For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
[Second Book of the Kings 15:9] And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to
[Second Book of the Kings 15:10] But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
[Second Book of the Kings 15:11] And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that
[Second Book of the Kings 15:12] And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s
[Second Book of the Kings 15:13] And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the
[Second Book of the Kings 15:14] And David said unto all his servants that were with him at
[Second Book of the Kings 15:15] And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants
[Second Book of the Kings 15:16] And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And
[Second Book of the Kings 15:17] And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and
[Second Book of the Kings 15:18] And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the
[Second Book of the Kings 15:19] Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou
[Second Book of the Kings 15:20] Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee
[Second Book of the Kings 15:21] And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and
[Second Book of the Kings 15:22] And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite
[Second Book of the Kings 15:23] And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
[Second Book of the Kings 15:24] And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing
[Second Book of the Kings 15:25] And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the
[Second Book of the Kings 15:27] The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?
[Second Book of the Kings 15:28] See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there
[Second Book of the Kings 15:29] Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to
[Second Book of the Kings 15:30] And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he
[Second Book of the Kings 15:31] And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators
[Second Book of the Kings 15:32] And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the
[Second Book of the Kings 15:35] And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the
[Second Book of the Kings 15:36] Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz
[Second Book of the Kings 15:37] So Hushai David’s friend came into the city, and Absalom came
[Second Book of the Kings 16:1] And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold,
[Second Book of the Kings 16:2] And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba
[Second Book of the Kings 16:3] And the king said, And where is thy master’s son? And Ziba said
[Second Book of the Kings 16:4] Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained
[Second Book of the Kings 16:5] And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a
[Second Book of the Kings 16:6] And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king
[Second Book of the Kings 16:7] And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou
[Second Book of the Kings 16:9] Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should
[Second Book of the Kings 16:10] And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
[Second Book of the Kings 16:12] It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that
[Second Book of the Kings 16:13] And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on
[Second Book of the Kings 16:14] And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary,
[Second Book of the Kings 16:15] And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to
[Second Book of the Kings 16:16] And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend,
[Second Book of the Kings 16:17] And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend?
[Second Book of the Kings 16:19] And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the
[Second Book of the Kings 16:20] Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we
[Second Book of the Kings 16:21] And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s
[Second Book of the Kings 16:22] So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and
[Second Book of the Kings 16:23] And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those
[Second Book of the Kings 17:1] Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out
[Second Book of the Kings 17:4] And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of
[Second Book of the Kings 17:5] Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us
[Second Book of the Kings 17:6] And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,
[Second Book of the Kings 17:7] And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath
[Second Book of the Kings 17:8] For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they
[Second Book of the Kings 17:9] Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it
[Second Book of the Kings 17:10] And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a
[Second Book of the Kings 17:11] Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto
[Second Book of the Kings 17:12] So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found,
[Second Book of the Kings 17:13] Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel
[Second Book of the Kings 17:14] And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of
[Second Book of the Kings 17:15] Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus
[Second Book of the Kings 17:16] Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not
[Second Book of the Kings 17:17] Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not
[Second Book of the Kings 17:18] Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went
[Second Book of the Kings 17:19] And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth,
[Second Book of the Kings 17:20] And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house, they
[Second Book of the Kings 17:21] And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up
[Second Book of the Kings 17:22] Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and
[Second Book of the Kings 17:23] And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he
[Second Book of the Kings 17:24] Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he
[Second Book of the Kings 17:25] And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:
[Second Book of the Kings 17:26] So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.
[Second Book of the Kings 17:27] And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi
[Second Book of the Kings 17:28] Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and
[Second Book of the Kings 18:1] And David numbered the people that were with him, and set
[Second Book of the Kings 18:2] And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of
[Second Book of the Kings 18:3] But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee
[Second Book of the Kings 18:4] And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And
[Second Book of the Kings 18:5] And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal
[Second Book of the Kings 18:6] So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the
[Second Book of the Kings 18:8] For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the
[Second Book of the Kings 18:9] And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a
[Second Book of the Kings 18:10] And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw
[Second Book of the Kings 18:11] And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou
[Second Book of the Kings 18:12] And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
[Second Book of the Kings 18:13] Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life:
[Second Book of the Kings 18:14] Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took
[Second Book of the Kings 18:15] And ten young men that bare Joab’s armour compassed about and
[Second Book of the Kings 18:16] And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing
[Second Book of the Kings 18:17] And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the
[Second Book of the Kings 18:18] Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself
[Second Book of the Kings 18:19] Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the
[Second Book of the Kings 18:20] And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,
[Second Book of the Kings 18:21] Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.
[Second Book of the Kings 18:22] Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But
[Second Book of the Kings 18:24] And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to
[Second Book of the Kings 18:25] And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If
[Second Book of the Kings 18:26] And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman
[Second Book of the Kings 18:27] And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost
[Second Book of the Kings 18:28] And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he
[Second Book of the Kings 18:29] And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz
[Second Book of the Kings 18:30] And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he
[Second Book of the Kings 18:31] And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the
[Second Book of the Kings 18:32] And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And
[Second Book of the Kings 18:33] And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the
[Second Book of the Kings 19:2] And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the
[Second Book of the Kings 19:3] And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as
[Second Book of the Kings 19:4] But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud
[Second Book of the Kings 19:7] Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy
[Second Book of the Kings 19:8] Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all
[Second Book of the Kings 19:9] And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of
[Second Book of the Kings 19:10] And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now
[Second Book of the Kings 19:12] Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then
[Second Book of the Kings 19:14] And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the
[Second Book of the Kings 19:15] So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to
[Second Book of the Kings 19:16] And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
[Second Book of the Kings 19:17] And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the
[Second Book of the Kings 19:18] And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king’s
[Second Book of the Kings 19:20] For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold,
[Second Book of the Kings 19:21] But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not
[Second Book of the Kings 19:24] And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and
[Second Book of the Kings 19:25] And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the
[Second Book of the Kings 19:27] And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my
[Second Book of the Kings 19:28] For all of my father’s house were but dead men before my lord
[Second Book of the Kings 19:30] And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,
[Second Book of the Kings 19:31] And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went
[Second Book of the Kings 19:32] Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and
[Second Book of the Kings 19:33] And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I
[Second Book of the Kings 19:34] And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that
[Second Book of the Kings 19:38] And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will
[Second Book of the Kings 19:39] And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come
[Second Book of the Kings 19:40] Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:
[Second Book of the Kings 19:41] And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said
[Second Book of the Kings 20:1] And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was
[Second Book of the Kings 20:2] So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed
[Second Book of the Kings 20:3] And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the
[Second Book of the Kings 20:4] Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within
[Second Book of the Kings 20:5] So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer
[Second Book of the Kings 20:6] And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do
[Second Book of the Kings 20:7] And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites, and
[Second Book of the Kings 20:8] When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went
[Second Book of the Kings 20:9] And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab
[Second Book of the Kings 20:10] But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand: so
[Second Book of the Kings 20:11] And one of Joab’s men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth
[Second Book of the Kings 20:12] And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And
[Second Book of the Kings 20:13] When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on
[Second Book of the Kings 20:14] And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to
[Second Book of the Kings 20:15] And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they
[Second Book of the Kings 20:16] Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray
[Second Book of the Kings 20:17] And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou
[Second Book of the Kings 20:18] Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,
[Second Book of the Kings 20:19] I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou
[Second Book of the Kings 20:21] The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son
[Second Book of the Kings 20:22] Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they
[Second Book of the Kings 20:23] Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of
[Second Book of the Kings 21:1] Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year
[Second Book of the Kings 21:2] And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the
[Second Book of the Kings 21:3] Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for
[Second Book of the Kings 21:5] And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that
[Second Book of the Kings 21:7] But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of
[Second Book of the Kings 21:8] But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
[Second Book of the Kings 21:10] And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
[Second Book of the Kings 21:11] And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the
[Second Book of the Kings 21:12] And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of
[Second Book of the Kings 21:14] And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the
[Second Book of the Kings 21:15] Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and
[Second Book of the Kings 21:16] And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight
[Second Book of the Kings 21:17] But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the
[Second Book of the Kings 21:18] And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle
[Second Book of the Kings 21:19] And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where
[Second Book of the Kings 21:20] And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great
[Second Book of the Kings 21:21] And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the
[Second Book of the Kings 21:22] These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand
[Second Book of the Kings 22:1] And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day
[Second Book of the Kings 22:4] I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I
[Second Book of the Kings 22:5] When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men
[Second Book of the Kings 22:8] Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven
[Second Book of the Kings 22:9] There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
[Second Book of the Kings 22:10] He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under
[Second Book of the Kings 22:11] And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the
[Second Book of the Kings 22:12] And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and
[Second Book of the Kings 22:13] Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.
[Second Book of the Kings 22:14] The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his
[Second Book of the Kings 22:15] And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and
[Second Book of the Kings 22:16] And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the
[Second Book of the Kings 22:17] He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
[Second Book of the Kings 22:18] He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated
[Second Book of the Kings 22:19] They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my
[Second Book of the Kings 22:20] He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,
[Second Book of the Kings 22:21] The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to
[Second Book of the Kings 22:22] For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
[Second Book of the Kings 22:23] For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I
[Second Book of the Kings 22:24] I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine
[Second Book of the Kings 22:25] Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my
[Second Book of the Kings 22:26] With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the
[Second Book of the Kings 22:27] With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward
[Second Book of the Kings 22:28] And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon
[Second Book of the Kings 22:29] For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my
[Second Book of the Kings 22:30] For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped
[Second Book of the Kings 22:31] As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried:
[Second Book of the Kings 22:32] For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?
[Second Book of the Kings 22:33] God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.
[Second Book of the Kings 22:34] He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet: and setteth me upon my high
[Second Book of the Kings 22:35] He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by
[Second Book of the Kings 22:36] Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
[Second Book of the Kings 22:37] Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not
[Second Book of the Kings 22:38] I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not
[Second Book of the Kings 22:39] And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not
[Second Book of the Kings 22:40] For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose
[Second Book of the Kings 22:41] Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might
[Second Book of the Kings 22:42] They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but
[Second Book of the Kings 22:43] Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did
[Second Book of the Kings 22:44] Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
[Second Book of the Kings 22:45] Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear,
[Second Book of the Kings 22:46] Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their
[Second Book of the Kings 22:47] The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God
[Second Book of the Kings 22:48] It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people
[Second Book of the Kings 22:49] And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast
[Second Book of the Kings 22:50] Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
[Second Book of the Kings 22:51] He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to
[Second Book of the Kings 23:1] Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse
[Second Book of the Kings 23:3] The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that
[Second Book of the Kings 23:4] And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,
[Second Book of the Kings 23:5] Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an
[Second Book of the Kings 23:6] But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust
[Second Book of the Kings 23:8] These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The
[Second Book of the Kings 23:9] And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the
[Second Book of the Kings 23:11] And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the
[Second Book of the Kings 23:12] But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and
[Second Book of the Kings 23:13] And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in
[Second Book of the Kings 23:14] And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the
[Second Book of the Kings 23:15] And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of
[Second Book of the Kings 23:17] And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this:
[Second Book of the Kings 23:18] And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief
[Second Book of the Kings 23:19] Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their
[Second Book of the Kings 23:20] And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of
[Second Book of the Kings 23:21] And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a
[Second Book of the Kings 23:22] These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name
[Second Book of the Kings 23:23] He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to
[Second Book of the Kings 23:24] Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the
[Second Book of the Kings 23:27] Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 23:28 Zalmon
[Second Book of the Kings 24:1] And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and
[Second Book of the Kings 24:2] For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with
[Second Book of the Kings 24:3] And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the
[Second Book of the Kings 24:5] And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right
[Second Book of the Kings 24:8] So when they had gone through all the land, they came to
[Second Book of the Kings 24:9] And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the
[Second Book of the Kings 24:10] And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the
[Second Book of the Kings 24:11] For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came
[Second Book of the Kings 24:13] So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall
[Second Book of the Kings 24:14] And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now
[Second Book of the Kings 24:15] So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even
[Second Book of the Kings 24:16] And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to
[Second Book of the Kings 24:17] And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote
[Second Book of the Kings 24:18] And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear
[Second Book of the Kings 24:19] And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD
[Second Book of the Kings 24:20] And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on
[Second Book of the Kings 24:21] And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his
[Second Book of the Kings 24:22] And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer
[Second Book of the Kings 24:23] All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And
[Second Book of the Kings 24:24] And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of
[Second Book of the Kings 24:25] And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt
[Third Book of the Kings 1:1] Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
[Third Book of the Kings 1:2] Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my
[Third Book of the Kings 1:3] So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of
[Third Book of the Kings 1:4] And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and
[Third Book of the Kings 1:5] Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will
[Third Book of the Kings 1:6] And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why
[Third Book of the Kings 1:7] And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar
[Third Book of the Kings 1:8] But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan
[Third Book of the Kings 1:9] And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of
[Third Book of the Kings 1:11] Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,
[Third Book of the Kings 1:13] Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not
[Third Book of the Kings 1:15] And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the
[Third Book of the Kings 1:16] And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the
[Third Book of the Kings 1:18] And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king,
[Third Book of the Kings 1:20] And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee,
[Third Book of the Kings 1:21] Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall
[Third Book of the Kings 1:22] And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet
[Third Book of the Kings 1:23] And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And
[Third Book of the Kings 1:24] And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall
[Third Book of the Kings 1:26] But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah
[Third Book of the Kings 1:27] Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed
[Third Book of the Kings 1:29] And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath
[Third Book of the Kings 1:31] Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did
[Third Book of the Kings 1:32] And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
[Third Book of the Kings 1:33] The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your
[Third Book of the Kings 1:35] Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my
[Third Book of the Kings 1:36] And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,
[Third Book of the Kings 1:37] As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with
[Third Book of the Kings 1:38] So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son
[Third Book of the Kings 1:39] And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle,
[Third Book of the Kings 1:40] And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with
[Third Book of the Kings 1:41] And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as
[Third Book of the Kings 1:43] And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king
[Third Book of the Kings 1:44] And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
[Third Book of the Kings 1:45] And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him
[Third Book of the Kings 1:46] And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
[Third Book of the Kings 1:47] And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king
[Third Book of the Kings 1:48] And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,
[Third Book of the Kings 1:49] And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose
[Third Book of the Kings 1:50] And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and
[Third Book of the Kings 1:51] And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king
[Third Book of the Kings 1:52] And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there
[Third Book of the Kings 1:53] So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.
[Third Book of the Kings 2:1] Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged
[Third Book of the Kings 2:5] Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,
[Third Book of the Kings 2:6] Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go
[Third Book of the Kings 2:7] But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and
[Third Book of the Kings 2:8] And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a
[Third Book of the Kings 2:9] Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and
[Third Book of the Kings 2:10] So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
[Third Book of the Kings 2:11] And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years:
[Third Book of the Kings 2:12] Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his
[Third Book of the Kings 2:13] And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of
[Third Book of the Kings 2:14] He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said,
[Third Book of the Kings 2:15] And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all
[Third Book of the Kings 2:16] And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said
[Third Book of the Kings 2:17] And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he
[Third Book of the Kings 2:18] And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.
[Third Book of the Kings 2:19] Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for
[Third Book of the Kings 2:20] Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee,
[Third Book of the Kings 2:21] And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy
[Third Book of the Kings 2:22] And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost
[Third Book of the Kings 2:23] Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and
[Third Book of the Kings 2:24] Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and
[Third Book of the Kings 2:25] And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;
[Third Book of the Kings 2:26] And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth,
[Third Book of the Kings 2:27] So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD;
[Third Book of the Kings 2:28] Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
[Third Book of the Kings 2:29] And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the
[Third Book of the Kings 2:30] And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto
[Third Book of the Kings 2:31] And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon
[Third Book of the Kings 2:32] And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell
[Third Book of the Kings 2:33] Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and
[Third Book of the Kings 2:34] So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and
[Third Book of the Kings 2:35] And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the
[Third Book of the Kings 2:36] And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build
[Third Book of the Kings 2:37] For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over
[Third Book of the Kings 2:38] And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the
[Third Book of the Kings 2:39] And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the
[Third Book of the Kings 2:40] And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish
[Third Book of the Kings 2:41] And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to
[Third Book of the Kings 2:42] And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I
[Third Book of the Kings 2:43] Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the
[Third Book of the Kings 2:46] So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went
[Third Book of the Kings 3:1] And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
[Third Book of the Kings 3:2] Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no
[Third Book of the Kings 3:3] And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his
[Third Book of the Kings 3:4] And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the
[Third Book of the Kings 3:5] In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and
[Third Book of the Kings 3:6] And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my
[Third Book of the Kings 3:7] And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of
[Third Book of the Kings 3:8] And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast
[Third Book of the Kings 3:9] Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy
[Third Book of the Kings 3:11] And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and
[Third Book of the Kings 3:13] And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both
[Third Book of the Kings 3:14] And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
[Third Book of the Kings 3:15] And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to
[Third Book of the Kings 3:16] Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and
[Third Book of the Kings 3:17] And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one
[Third Book of the Kings 3:18] And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,
[Third Book of the Kings 3:19] And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid
[Third Book of the Kings 3:20] And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while
[Third Book of the Kings 3:21] And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it
[Third Book of the Kings 3:22] And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the
[Third Book of the Kings 3:23] Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,
[Third Book of the Kings 3:24] And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword
[Third Book of the Kings 3:25] And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half
[Third Book of the Kings 3:26] Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,
[Third Book of the Kings 3:27] Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and
[Third Book of the Kings 3:28] And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged;
[Third Book of the Kings 4:1] So king Solomon was king over all Israel.
[Third Book of the Kings 4:2] And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok
[Third Book of the Kings 4:4] And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and
[Third Book of the Kings 4:7] And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided
[Third Book of the Kings 4:8] And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: 4:9
[Third Book of the Kings 4:12] Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo,
[Third Book of the Kings 4:13] The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of
[Third Book of the Kings 4:15] Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of
[Third Book of the Kings 4:20] Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in
[Third Book of the Kings 4:21] And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the
[Third Book of the Kings 4:22] And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine
[Third Book of the Kings 4:24] For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river,
[Third Book of the Kings 4:25] And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and
[Third Book of the Kings 4:26] And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots,
[Third Book of the Kings 4:27] And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all
[Third Book of the Kings 4:28] Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they
[Third Book of the Kings 4:29] And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and
[Third Book of the Kings 4:30] And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of
[Third Book of the Kings 4:31] For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
[Third Book of the Kings 4:32] And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a
[Third Book of the Kings 4:33] And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon
[Third Book of the Kings 4:34] And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from
[Third Book of the Kings 5:1] And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had
[Third Book of the Kings 5:2] And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 5:3 Thou knowest how that David
[Third Book of the Kings 5:4] But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that
[Third Book of the Kings 5:5] And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD
[Third Book of the Kings 5:6] Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of
[Third Book of the Kings 5:7] And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that
[Third Book of the Kings 5:8] And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things
[Third Book of the Kings 5:9] My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I
[Third Book of the Kings 5:10] So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all
[Third Book of the Kings 5:11] And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food
[Third Book of the Kings 5:12] And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there
[Third Book of the Kings 5:13] And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy
[Third Book of the Kings 5:14] And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a
[Third Book of the Kings 5:15] And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,
[Third Book of the Kings 5:17] And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly
[Third Book of the Kings 5:18] And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew them, and the
[Third Book of the Kings 6:1] And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after
[Third Book of the Kings 6:2] And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length
[Third Book of the Kings 6:3] And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was
[Third Book of the Kings 6:4] And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
[Third Book of the Kings 6:5] And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,
[Third Book of the Kings 6:7] And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made
[Third Book of the Kings 6:8] The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the
[Third Book of the Kings 6:9] So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with
[Third Book of the Kings 6:10] And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits
[Third Book of the Kings 6:11] And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying, 6:12 Concerning
[Third Book of the Kings 6:14] So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
[Third Book of the Kings 6:15] And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar,
[Third Book of the Kings 6:16] And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the
[Third Book of the Kings 6:17] And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits
[Third Book of the Kings 6:18] And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open
[Third Book of the Kings 6:19] And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the
[Third Book of the Kings 6:20] And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and
[Third Book of the Kings 6:21] So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made
[Third Book of the Kings 6:22] And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished
[Third Book of the Kings 6:23] And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each
[Third Book of the Kings 6:24] And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits
[Third Book of the Kings 6:25] And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of
[Third Book of the Kings 6:26] The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the
[Third Book of the Kings 6:27] And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they
[Third Book of the Kings 6:28] And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
[Third Book of the Kings 6:29] And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved
[Third Book of the Kings 6:30] And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
[Third Book of the Kings 6:31] And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree:
[Third Book of the Kings 6:32] The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them
[Third Book of the Kings 6:33] So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a
[Third Book of the Kings 6:34] And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one
[Third Book of the Kings 6:35] And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers:
[Third Book of the Kings 6:36] And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and
[Third Book of the Kings 6:37] In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD
[Third Book of the Kings 7:1] But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he
[Third Book of the Kings 7:2] He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length
[Third Book of the Kings 7:3] And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on
[Third Book of the Kings 7:4] And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light
[Third Book of the Kings 7:5] And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and
[Third Book of the Kings 7:6] And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty
[Third Book of the Kings 7:7] Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the
[Third Book of the Kings 7:8] And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch,
[Third Book of the Kings 7:9] All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of
[Third Book of the Kings 7:10] And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,
[Third Book of the Kings 7:11] And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones,
[Third Book of the Kings 7:12] And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed
[Third Book of the Kings 7:13] And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
[Third Book of the Kings 7:14] He was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was
[Third Book of the Kings 7:15] For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece:
[Third Book of the Kings 7:16] And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops
[Third Book of the Kings 7:18] And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one
[Third Book of the Kings 7:19] And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of
[Third Book of the Kings 7:20] And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also
[Third Book of the Kings 7:21] And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set
[Third Book of the Kings 7:22] And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of
[Third Book of the Kings 7:23] And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the
[Third Book of the Kings 7:24] And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing
[Third Book of the Kings 7:25] It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
[Third Book of the Kings 7:26] And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was
[Third Book of the Kings 7:27] And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one
[Third Book of the Kings 7:28] And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders,
[Third Book of the Kings 7:30] And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and
[Third Book of the Kings 7:31] And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit:
[Third Book of the Kings 7:32] And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the
[Third Book of the Kings 7:33] And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel:
[Third Book of the Kings 7:34] And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base:
[Third Book of the Kings 7:35] And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a
[Third Book of the Kings 7:36] For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders
[Third Book of the Kings 7:37] After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one
[Third Book of the Kings 7:38] Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty
[Third Book of the Kings 7:39] And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on
[Third Book of the Kings 7:40] And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So
[Third Book of the Kings 7:46] In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
[Third Book of the Kings 7:47] And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were
[Third Book of the Kings 7:48] And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of
[Third Book of the Kings 7:51] So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of
[Third Book of the Kings 8:1] Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of
[Third Book of the Kings 8:2] And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon
[Third Book of the Kings 8:3] And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the
[Third Book of the Kings 8:4] And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the
[Third Book of the Kings 8:5] And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were
[Third Book of the Kings 8:6] And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
[Third Book of the Kings 8:7] For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of
[Third Book of the Kings 8:8] And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were
[Third Book of the Kings 8:9] There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which
[Third Book of the Kings 8:10] And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
[Third Book of the Kings 8:12] Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the
[Third Book of the Kings 8:13] I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place
[Third Book of the Kings 8:14] And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the
[Third Book of the Kings 8:15] And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with
[Third Book of the Kings 8:17] And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for
[Third Book of the Kings 8:18] And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine
[Third Book of the Kings 8:19] Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that
[Third Book of the Kings 8:20] And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am
[Third Book of the Kings 8:21] And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant
[Third Book of the Kings 8:22] And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of
[Third Book of the Kings 8:24] Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou
[Third Book of the Kings 8:25] Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my
[Third Book of the Kings 8:26] And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified,
[Third Book of the Kings 8:27] But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and
[Third Book of the Kings 8:29] That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even
[Third Book of the Kings 8:30] And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy
[Third Book of the Kings 8:31] If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid
[Third Book of the Kings 8:33] When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because
[Third Book of the Kings 8:35] When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have
[Third Book of the Kings 8:37] If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting,
[Third Book of the Kings 8:39] Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do,
[Third Book of the Kings 8:41] Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel,
[Third Book of the Kings 8:43] Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all
[Third Book of the Kings 8:44] If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever
[Third Book of the Kings 8:46] If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,)
[Third Book of the Kings 8:47] Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they
[Third Book of the Kings 8:49] Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy
[Third Book of the Kings 8:51] For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou
[Third Book of the Kings 8:52] That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant,
[Third Book of the Kings 8:53] For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the
[Third Book of the Kings 8:54] And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all
[Third Book of the Kings 8:55] And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a
[Third Book of the Kings 8:57] The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him
[Third Book of the Kings 8:59] And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before
[Third Book of the Kings 8:61] Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to
[Third Book of the Kings 8:62] And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before
[Third Book of the Kings 8:63] And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
[Third Book of the Kings 8:64] The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was
[Third Book of the Kings 8:65] And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a
[Third Book of the Kings 8:66] On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the
[Third Book of the Kings 9:1] And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the
[Third Book of the Kings 9:3] And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy
[Third Book of the Kings 9:4] And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in
[Third Book of the Kings 9:6] But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your
[Third Book of the Kings 9:7] Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given
[Third Book of the Kings 9:10] And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had
[Third Book of the Kings 9:11] (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
[Third Book of the Kings 9:12] And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had
[Third Book of the Kings 9:13] And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my
[Third Book of the Kings 9:14] And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.
[Third Book of the Kings 9:15] And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for
[Third Book of the Kings 9:16] For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt
[Third Book of the Kings 9:17] And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether, 9:18 And
[Third Book of the Kings 9:20] And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,
[Third Book of the Kings 9:22] But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but
[Third Book of the Kings 9:23] These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon’s
[Third Book of the Kings 9:24] But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her
[Third Book of the Kings 9:25] And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and
[Third Book of the Kings 9:26] And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is
[Third Book of the Kings 9:27] And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had
[Third Book of the Kings 9:28] And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four
[Third Book of the Kings 10:1] And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
[Third Book of the Kings 10:2] And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels
[Third Book of the Kings 10:3] And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing
[Third Book of the Kings 10:4] And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and
[Third Book of the Kings 10:6] And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in
[Third Book of the Kings 10:7] Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had
[Third Book of the Kings 10:8] Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand
[Third Book of the Kings 10:9] Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee
[Third Book of the Kings 10:10] And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and
[Third Book of the Kings 10:11] And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir,
[Third Book of the Kings 10:12] And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of
[Third Book of the Kings 10:13] And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,
[Third Book of the Kings 10:14] Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
[Third Book of the Kings 10:16] And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
[Third Book of the Kings 10:17] And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of
[Third Book of the Kings 10:18] Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it
[Third Book of the Kings 10:19] The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round
[Third Book of the Kings 10:20] And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
[Third Book of the Kings 10:21] And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all
[Third Book of the Kings 10:22] For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of
[Third Book of the Kings 10:23] So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches
[Third Book of the Kings 10:24] And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which
[Third Book of the Kings 10:25] And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
[Third Book of the Kings 10:26] And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had
[Third Book of the Kings 10:27] And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and
[Third Book of the Kings 10:28] And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the
[Third Book of the Kings 10:29] And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
[Third Book of the Kings 11:1] But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the
[Third Book of the Kings 11:3] And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
[Third Book of the Kings 11:4] For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned
[Third Book of the Kings 11:5] For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,
[Third Book of the Kings 11:6] And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully
[Third Book of the Kings 11:7] Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination
[Third Book of the Kings 11:8] And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt
[Third Book of the Kings 11:9] And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned
[Third Book of the Kings 11:11] Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done
[Third Book of the Kings 11:12] Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy
[Third Book of the Kings 11:13] Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one
[Third Book of the Kings 11:14] And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the
[Third Book of the Kings 11:15] For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the
[Third Book of the Kings 11:18] And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took
[Third Book of the Kings 11:19] And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he
[Third Book of the Kings 11:20] And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom
[Third Book of the Kings 11:21] And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers,
[Third Book of the Kings 11:22] Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,
[Third Book of the Kings 11:23] And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of
[Third Book of the Kings 11:25] And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
[Third Book of the Kings 11:26] And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,
[Third Book of the Kings 11:27] And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the
[Third Book of the Kings 11:28] And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon
[Third Book of the Kings 11:29] And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
[Third Book of the Kings 11:34] Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I
[Third Book of the Kings 11:35] But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give
[Third Book of the Kings 11:36] And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant
[Third Book of the Kings 11:37] And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that
[Third Book of the Kings 11:38] And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command
[Third Book of the Kings 11:39] And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
[Third Book of the Kings 11:40] Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,
[Third Book of the Kings 11:41] And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and
[Third Book of the Kings 11:42] And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
[Third Book of the Kings 11:43] And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
[Third Book of the Kings 12:1] And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem
[Third Book of the Kings 12:2] And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet
[Third Book of the Kings 12:5] And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again
[Third Book of the Kings 12:6] And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before
[Third Book of the Kings 12:8] But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given
[Third Book of the Kings 12:11] And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will
[Third Book of the Kings 12:12] So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
[Third Book of the Kings 12:13] And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old
[Third Book of the Kings 12:15] Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause
[Third Book of the Kings 12:16] So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them,
[Third Book of the Kings 12:17] But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of
[Third Book of the Kings 12:18] Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and
[Third Book of the Kings 12:19] So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
[Third Book of the Kings 12:20] And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was
[Third Book of the Kings 12:21] And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the
[Third Book of the Kings 12:22] But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
[Third Book of the Kings 12:23] Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto
[Third Book of the Kings 12:25] Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein;
[Third Book of the Kings 12:26] And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to
[Third Book of the Kings 12:28] Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold,
[Third Book of the Kings 12:29] And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.
[Third Book of the Kings 12:30] And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship
[Third Book of the Kings 12:31] And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the
[Third Book of the Kings 12:32] And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the
[Third Book of the Kings 12:33] So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the
[Third Book of the Kings 13:1] And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of
[Third Book of the Kings 13:2] And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said,
[Third Book of the Kings 13:3] And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which
[Third Book of the Kings 13:4] And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the
[Third Book of the Kings 13:5] The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar,
[Third Book of the Kings 13:6] And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now
[Third Book of the Kings 13:7] And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and
[Third Book of the Kings 13:8] And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half
[Third Book of the Kings 13:10] So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came
[Third Book of the Kings 13:11] Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and
[Third Book of the Kings 13:12] And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons
[Third Book of the Kings 13:13] And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled
[Third Book of the Kings 13:15] Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
[Third Book of the Kings 13:16] And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:
[Third Book of the Kings 13:17] For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no
[Third Book of the Kings 13:18] He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel
[Third Book of the Kings 13:19] So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and
[Third Book of the Kings 13:20] And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of
[Third Book of the Kings 13:23] And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had
[Third Book of the Kings 13:24] And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:
[Third Book of the Kings 13:25] And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way,
[Third Book of the Kings 13:26] And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
[Third Book of the Kings 13:27] And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they
[Third Book of the Kings 13:28] And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass
[Third Book of the Kings 13:29] And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid
[Third Book of the Kings 13:30] And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over
[Third Book of the Kings 13:33] After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but
[Third Book of the Kings 13:34] And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to
[Third Book of the Kings 14:1] At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
[Third Book of the Kings 14:2] And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise
[Third Book of the Kings 14:3] And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of
[Third Book of the Kings 14:4] And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and
[Third Book of the Kings 14:5] And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam
[Third Book of the Kings 14:6] And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she
[Third Book of the Kings 14:7] Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch
[Third Book of the Kings 14:11] Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and
[Third Book of the Kings 14:12] Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy
[Third Book of the Kings 14:13] And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of
[Third Book of the Kings 14:14] Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who
[Third Book of the Kings 14:15] For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the
[Third Book of the Kings 14:16] And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who
[Third Book of the Kings 14:17] And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and
[Third Book of the Kings 14:19] And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he
[Third Book of the Kings 14:20] And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:
[Third Book of the Kings 14:21] And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was
[Third Book of the Kings 14:22] And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked
[Third Book of the Kings 14:23] For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on
[Third Book of the Kings 14:24] And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did
[Third Book of the Kings 14:25] And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that
[Third Book of the Kings 14:27] And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and
[Third Book of the Kings 14:28] And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD,
[Third Book of the Kings 14:29] Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are
[Third Book of the Kings 14:30] And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
[Third Book of the Kings 14:31] And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
[Third Book of the Kings 15:1] Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat
[Third Book of the Kings 15:2] Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother’s name was
[Third Book of the Kings 15:3] And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done
[Third Book of the Kings 15:4] Nevertheless for David’s sake did the LORD his God give him a
[Third Book of the Kings 15:6] And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of
[Third Book of the Kings 15:7] Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they
[Third Book of the Kings 15:8] And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the
[Third Book of the Kings 15:9] And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa
[Third Book of the Kings 15:10] And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his
[Third Book of the Kings 15:11] And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did
[Third Book of the Kings 15:12] And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all
[Third Book of the Kings 15:13] And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being
[Third Book of the Kings 15:14] But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa’s heart
[Third Book of the Kings 15:15] And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and
[Third Book of the Kings 15:16] And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
[Third Book of the Kings 15:17] And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built
[Third Book of the Kings 15:18] Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the
[Third Book of the Kings 15:20] So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
[Third Book of the Kings 15:21] And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off
[Third Book of the Kings 15:22] Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was
[Third Book of the Kings 15:23] The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that
[Third Book of the Kings 15:24] And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
[Third Book of the Kings 15:25] And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the
[Third Book of the Kings 15:26] And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way
[Third Book of the Kings 15:27] And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,
[Third Book of the Kings 15:28] Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him,
[Third Book of the Kings 15:29] And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the
[Third Book of the Kings 15:31] Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they
[Third Book of the Kings 15:32] And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
[Third Book of the Kings 15:33] In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of
[Third Book of the Kings 15:34] And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way
[Third Book of the Kings 16:1] Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against
[Third Book of the Kings 16:4] Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him
[Third Book of the Kings 16:5] Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his
[Third Book of the Kings 16:7] And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came
[Third Book of the Kings 16:8] In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the
[Third Book of the Kings 16:9] And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
[Third Book of the Kings 16:10] And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty
[Third Book of the Kings 16:11] And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat
[Third Book of the Kings 16:12] Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the
[Third Book of the Kings 16:13] For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by
[Third Book of the Kings 16:14] Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they
[Third Book of the Kings 16:15] In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri
[Third Book of the Kings 16:16] And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath
[Third Book of the Kings 16:17] And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and
[Third Book of the Kings 16:18] And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,
[Third Book of the Kings 16:19] For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the
[Third Book of the Kings 16:20] Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he
[Third Book of the Kings 16:22] But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people
[Third Book of the Kings 16:23] In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to
[Third Book of the Kings 16:24] And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of
[Third Book of the Kings 16:25] But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse
[Third Book of the Kings 16:26] For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and
[Third Book of the Kings 16:27] Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might
[Third Book of the Kings 16:29] And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began
[Third Book of the Kings 16:30] And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above
[Third Book of the Kings 16:31] And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to
[Third Book of the Kings 16:32] And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which
[Third Book of the Kings 16:33] And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God
[Third Book of the Kings 16:34] In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the
[Third Book of the Kings 17:1] And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,
[Third Book of the Kings 17:2] And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 17:3 Get thee
[Third Book of the Kings 17:4] And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have
[Third Book of the Kings 17:5] So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he
[Third Book of the Kings 17:6] And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and
[Third Book of the Kings 17:7] And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,
[Third Book of the Kings 17:8] And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 17:9 Arise, get
[Third Book of the Kings 17:10] So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate
[Third Book of the Kings 17:11] And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,
[Third Book of the Kings 17:12] And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but
[Third Book of the Kings 17:13] And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said:
[Third Book of the Kings 17:14] For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall
[Third Book of the Kings 17:15] And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she,
[Third Book of the Kings 17:16] And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil
[Third Book of the Kings 17:17] And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the
[Third Book of the Kings 17:18] And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou
[Third Book of the Kings 17:20] And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou
[Third Book of the Kings 17:22] And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the
[Third Book of the Kings 17:23] And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the
[Third Book of the Kings 17:24] And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a
[Third Book of the Kings 18:1] And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD
[Third Book of the Kings 18:2] And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore
[Third Book of the Kings 18:3] And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.
[Third Book of the Kings 18:6] So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab
[Third Book of the Kings 18:7] And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he
[Third Book of the Kings 18:9] And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy
[Third Book of the Kings 18:11] And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
[Third Book of the Kings 18:12] And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that
[Third Book of the Kings 18:13] Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the
[Third Book of the Kings 18:15] And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
[Third Book of the Kings 18:16] So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to
[Third Book of the Kings 18:17] And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto
[Third Book of the Kings 18:19] Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount
[Third Book of the Kings 18:20] So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the
[Third Book of the Kings 18:21] And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye
[Third Book of the Kings 18:22] Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a
[Third Book of the Kings 18:23] Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one
[Third Book of the Kings 18:25] And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one
[Third Book of the Kings 18:26] And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed
[Third Book of the Kings 18:27] And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said,
[Third Book of the Kings 18:28] And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with
[Third Book of the Kings 18:29] And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied
[Third Book of the Kings 18:30] And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all
[Third Book of the Kings 18:31] And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the
[Third Book of the Kings 18:33] And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and
[Third Book of the Kings 18:34] And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second
[Third Book of the Kings 18:35] And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the
[Third Book of the Kings 18:36] And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
[Third Book of the Kings 18:37] Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou
[Third Book of the Kings 18:38] Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt
[Third Book of the Kings 18:39] And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and
[Third Book of the Kings 18:40] And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not
[Third Book of the Kings 18:41] And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there
[Third Book of the Kings 18:42] So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the
[Third Book of the Kings 18:44] And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,
[Third Book of the Kings 18:45] And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black
[Third Book of the Kings 18:46] And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his
[Third Book of the Kings 19:1] And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he
[Third Book of the Kings 19:2] Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the
[Third Book of the Kings 19:3] And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came
[Third Book of the Kings 19:4] But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came
[Third Book of the Kings 19:5] And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an
[Third Book of the Kings 19:6] And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals,
[Third Book of the Kings 19:7] And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched
[Third Book of the Kings 19:8] And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of
[Third Book of the Kings 19:9] And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold,
[Third Book of the Kings 19:11] And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.
[Third Book of the Kings 19:13] And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in
[Third Book of the Kings 19:15] And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the
[Third Book of the Kings 19:17] And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of
[Third Book of the Kings 19:18] Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which
[Third Book of the Kings 19:19] So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who
[Third Book of the Kings 19:20] And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I
[Third Book of the Kings 19:21] And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew
[Third Book of the Kings 20:1] And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together:
[Third Book of the Kings 20:2] And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and
[Third Book of the Kings 20:4] And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king,
[Third Book of the Kings 20:5] And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad,
[Third Book of the Kings 20:7] Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and
[Third Book of the Kings 20:8] And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not
[Third Book of the Kings 20:9] Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord
[Third Book of the Kings 20:10] And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me,
[Third Book of the Kings 20:11] And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him
[Third Book of the Kings 20:12] And it came to pass, when Benhadad heard this message, as he
[Third Book of the Kings 20:13] And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,
[Third Book of the Kings 20:14] And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even
[Third Book of the Kings 20:15] Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces,
[Third Book of the Kings 20:16] And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself
[Third Book of the Kings 20:17] And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out
[Third Book of the Kings 20:18] And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them
[Third Book of the Kings 20:19] So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of
[Third Book of the Kings 20:20] And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and
[Third Book of the Kings 20:21] And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and
[Third Book of the Kings 20:22] And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him,
[Third Book of the Kings 20:23] And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods
[Third Book of the Kings 20:24] And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his
[Third Book of the Kings 20:26] And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad
[Third Book of the Kings 20:27] And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present,
[Third Book of the Kings 20:28] And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel,
[Third Book of the Kings 20:29] And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so
[Third Book of the Kings 20:30] But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell
[Third Book of the Kings 20:31] And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that
[Third Book of the Kings 20:32] So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their
[Third Book of the Kings 20:33] Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come
[Third Book of the Kings 20:34] And Benhadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took
[Third Book of the Kings 20:35] And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his
[Third Book of the Kings 20:36] Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of
[Third Book of the Kings 20:37] Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And
[Third Book of the Kings 20:38] So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and
[Third Book of the Kings 20:39] And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said,
[Third Book of the Kings 20:40] And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the
[Third Book of the Kings 20:41] And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the
[Third Book of the Kings 20:42] And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let
[Third Book of the Kings 20:43] And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased,
[Third Book of the Kings 21:1] And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the
[Third Book of the Kings 21:2] And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I
[Third Book of the Kings 21:3] And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should
[Third Book of the Kings 21:4] And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the
[Third Book of the Kings 21:5] But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy
[Third Book of the Kings 21:7] And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the
[Third Book of the Kings 21:8] So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his
[Third Book of the Kings 21:9] And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set
[Third Book of the Kings 21:11] And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were
[Third Book of the Kings 21:12] They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
[Third Book of the Kings 21:13] And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before
[Third Book of the Kings 21:14] Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is
[Third Book of the Kings 21:15] And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned,
[Third Book of the Kings 21:16] And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that
[Third Book of the Kings 21:17] And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
[Third Book of the Kings 21:18] Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria:
[Third Book of the Kings 21:19] And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast
[Third Book of the Kings 21:20] And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And
[Third Book of the Kings 21:21] Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy
[Third Book of the Kings 21:23] And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat
[Third Book of the Kings 21:24] Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him
[Third Book of the Kings 21:25] But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to
[Third Book of the Kings 21:26] And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all
[Third Book of the Kings 21:27] And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent
[Third Book of the Kings 21:28] And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
[Third Book of the Kings 21:29] Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he
[Third Book of the Kings 22:1] And they continued three years without war between Syria and
[Third Book of the Kings 22:2] And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king
[Third Book of the Kings 22:3] And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that
[Third Book of the Kings 22:5] And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
[Third Book of the Kings 22:6] Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about
[Third Book of the Kings 22:7] And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
[Third Book of the Kings 22:9] Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten
[Third Book of the Kings 22:10] And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat
[Third Book of the Kings 22:11] And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he
[Third Book of the Kings 22:12] And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
[Third Book of the Kings 22:13] And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him,
[Third Book of the Kings 22:14] And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto
[Third Book of the Kings 22:15] So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,
[Third Book of the Kings 22:16] And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee
[Third Book of the Kings 22:18] And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
[Third Book of the Kings 22:20] And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up
[Third Book of the Kings 22:21] And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
[Third Book of the Kings 22:22] And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go
[Third Book of the Kings 22:23] Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
[Third Book of the Kings 22:24] But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah
[Third Book of the Kings 22:26] And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back
[Third Book of the Kings 22:28] And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath
[Third Book of the Kings 22:29] So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up
[Third Book of the Kings 22:30] And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
[Third Book of the Kings 22:31] But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that
[Third Book of the Kings 22:32] And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
[Third Book of the Kings 22:33] And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived
[Third Book of the Kings 22:34] And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of
[Third Book of the Kings 22:35] And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in
[Third Book of the Kings 22:36] And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the
[Third Book of the Kings 22:37] So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried
[Third Book of the Kings 22:38] And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs
[Third Book of the Kings 22:39] Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the
[Third Book of the Kings 22:40] So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in
[Third Book of the Kings 22:41] And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the
[Third Book of the Kings 22:42] Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to
[Third Book of the Kings 22:43] And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not
[Third Book of the Kings 22:44] And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
[Third Book of the Kings 22:45] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he
[Third Book of the Kings 22:47] There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.
[Third Book of the Kings 22:48] Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but
[Third Book of the Kings 22:49] Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my
[Third Book of the Kings 22:50] And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
[Third Book of the Kings 22:51] Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
[Third Book of the Kings 22:52] And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way
[Fourth Book of the Kings 1:1] Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
[Fourth Book of the Kings 1:2] And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that
[Fourth Book of the Kings 1:3] But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go
[Fourth Book of the Kings 1:5] And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 1:7] And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to
[Fourth Book of the Kings 1:9] Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And
[Fourth Book of the Kings 1:10] And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a
[Fourth Book of the Kings 1:11] Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his
[Fourth Book of the Kings 1:12] And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let
[Fourth Book of the Kings 1:13] And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.
[Fourth Book of the Kings 1:14] Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two
[Fourth Book of the Kings 1:15] And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be
[Fourth Book of the Kings 1:16] And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast
[Fourth Book of the Kings 1:17] So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had
[Fourth Book of the Kings 1:18] Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:2] And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:3] And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:4] And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:5] And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:6] And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:7] And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:8] And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:9] And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:10] And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:11] And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:12] And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:13] He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:15] And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:16] And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:17] And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:18] And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:20] And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:21] And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:22] So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:23] And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:24] And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 2:25] And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:1] Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:2] And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:3] Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:4] And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:5] But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:6] And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:7] And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:8] And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:9] So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:10] And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:11] But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:12] And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:13] And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:14] And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:15] But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:16] And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:17] For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:18] And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:19] And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:20] And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:21] And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:22] And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:24] And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:25] And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:26] And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for
[Fourth Book of the Kings 3:27] Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:1] Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:2] And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:3] Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:4] And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:5] So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:6] And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:7] Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:8] And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:9] And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:10] Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:11] And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:12] And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:13] And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:14] And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:15] And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:16] And he said, About this season, according to the time of life,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:17] And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:18] And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:19] And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:20] And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:21] And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:22] And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:23] And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:24] Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:25] So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:28] Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:30] And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:31] And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:32] And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:33] He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:34] And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:35] Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:36] And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:37] Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:38] And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:39] And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:40] So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:41] But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:42] And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:43] And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred
[Fourth Book of the Kings 4:44] So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:1] Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:2] And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:3] And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:4] And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:5] And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:6] And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:7] And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:8] And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:9] So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:10] And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:11] But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:12] Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:13] And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:15] And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:16] But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:17] And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:18] In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:19] And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:20] But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:21] So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:23] And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:24] And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:25] But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto
[Fourth Book of the Kings 5:26] And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:1] And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:2] Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:3] And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants.
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:4] So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:5] But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water:
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:6] And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:7] Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:8] Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:9] And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:10] And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:11] Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:13] And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:14] Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host:
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:15] And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:17] And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:18] And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:19] And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:20] And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:21] And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:23] And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:24] And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:25] And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:26] And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:27] And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:29] So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:30] And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:31] Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 6:32] But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:2] Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:3] And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate:
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:5] And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:6] For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:7] Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:8] And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:9] Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:10] So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:11] And he called the porters; and they told it to the king’s house
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:12] And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:13] And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:14] They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:15] And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:16] And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:17] And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:18] And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 7:20] And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:1] Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:2] And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God:
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:3] And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:4] And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:5] And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:6] And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:7] And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:8] And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:11] And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed:
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:12] And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:13] And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:14] So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:15] And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:16] And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:17] Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:18] And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:19] Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant’s
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:20] In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:21] So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:22] Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:23] And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:25] In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:26] Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:27] And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:28] And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael
[Fourth Book of the Kings 8:29] And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:1] And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:4] So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:5] And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting;
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:6] And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:7] And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:8] For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:11] Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:12] And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:13] Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:14] So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:15] But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:16] So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:17] And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:19] Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:20] And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:21] And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:22] And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:24] And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:25] Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:27] But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:28] And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:29] And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:30] And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:31] And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:33] And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:34] And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:35] And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:36] Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 9:37] And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:1] And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:4] But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:6] Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:7] And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:8] And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:9] And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:11] So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:12] And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:14] And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:15] And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:16] And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:17] And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:18] And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:19] Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:20] And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:21] And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:22] And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:23] And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:24] And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:25] And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:26] And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:27] And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:28] Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:29] Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:30] And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:31] But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:32] In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:34] Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all
[Fourth Book of the Kings 10:36] And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:1] And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:2] But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:3] And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:4] And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:5] And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:7] And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:8] And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:9] And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:10] And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:11] And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:12] And he brought forth the king’s son, and put the crown upon him,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:13] And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:14] And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:15] But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:16] And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:17] And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:18] And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:19] And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:20] And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in
[Fourth Book of the Kings 11:21] Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:1] In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:2] And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:3] But the high places were not taken away: the people still
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:4] And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:6] But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:7] Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:8] And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:9] But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:10] And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:11] And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:13] Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:14] But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:15] Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:16] The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:17] Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:18] And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:19] And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:20] And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in
[Fourth Book of the Kings 12:21] For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:1] In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:2] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:3] And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:4] And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him:
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:5] (And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:6] Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:8] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:10] In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:11] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:12] And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:14] Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:15] And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:16] And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow.
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:17] And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:18] And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:19] And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:20] And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:21] And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:22] But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:23] And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:24] So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in
[Fourth Book of the Kings 13:25] And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:1] In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:2] He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:3] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:4] Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:5] And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:6] But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:7] He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:8] Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:9] And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:10] Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:11] But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:12] And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:13] And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:14] And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:15] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:17] And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:18] And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:20] And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:21] And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:22] He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:23] In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:24] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:25] He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:26] For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:27] And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel
[Fourth Book of the Kings 14:28] Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:1] In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:2] Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:3] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:5] And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:6] And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:7] So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his

[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:10] And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:11] And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:12] This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:13] Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:14] For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:15] And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:16] Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:17] In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:18] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:19] And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:20] And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty

[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:26] And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:27] In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:28] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:29] In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:30] And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:31] And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:32] In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:33] Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:34] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:35] Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:36] Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are
[Fourth Book of the Kings 15:37] In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the

[Fourth Book of the Kings 16:3] But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made
[Fourth Book of the Kings 16:4] And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on
[Fourth Book of the Kings 16:5] Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel
[Fourth Book of the Kings 16:6] At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 16:7] So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 16:8] And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 16:9] And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 16:10] And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 16:11] And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king

[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:1] In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:2] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:3] Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:4] And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:5] Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:6] In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:7] For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:9] And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:10] And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:13] Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:14] Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:15] And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:16] And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:17] And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:18] Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:19] Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:20] And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:21] For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:22] For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:24] And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:25] And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:26] Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:27] Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:28] Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:29] Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:30] And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:32] So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:33] They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:34] Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:37] And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:38] And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget;
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:39] But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:40] Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former
[Fourth Book of the Kings 17:41] So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:1] Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:2] Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:3] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:4] He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:5] He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:6] For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:7] And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:8] He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:9] And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:10] And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:11] And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:13] Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:14] And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:15] And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:16] At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:17] And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:18] And when they had called to the king, there came out to them
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:19] And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:22] But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:24] How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:26] Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:27] But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:31] Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:33] Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land
[Fourth Book of the Kings 18:37] Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:1] And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:2] And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:3] And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:4] It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:5] So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:6] And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:7] Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:8] So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:9] And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:11] Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:12] Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:15] And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:16] LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:17] Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:19] Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:20] Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:21] This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:22] Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:23] By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast said,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:24] I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:25] Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:26] Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:27] But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:28] Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:29] And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:30] And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:31] For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:32] Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:33] By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:34] For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:35] And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:36] So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 19:37] And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 20:1] In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet
[Fourth Book of the Kings 20:2] Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 20:4] And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle
[Fourth Book of the Kings 20:6] And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver
[Fourth Book of the Kings 20:7] And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it
[Fourth Book of the Kings 20:8] And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 20:11] And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 20:12] At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 20:13] And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house
[Fourth Book of the Kings 20:14] Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
[Fourth Book of the Kings 20:15] And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
[Fourth Book of the Kings 20:16] And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.
[Fourth Book of the Kings 20:17] Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that
[Fourth Book of the Kings 20:18] And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
[Fourth Book of the Kings 20:19] Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:1] Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:2] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:3] For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:4] And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:5] And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:6] And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:7] And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:9] But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:10] And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying, 21:11
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:13] And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:14] And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:16] Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:17] Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:19] Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:20] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:21] And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:23] And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:24] And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
[Fourth Book of the Kings 21:25] Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not
[Fourth Book of the Kings 22:1] Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
[Fourth Book of the Kings 22:2] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 22:3] And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that
[Fourth Book of the Kings 22:7] Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that
[Fourth Book of the Kings 22:8] And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have
[Fourth Book of the Kings 22:9] And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king
[Fourth Book of the Kings 22:10] And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 22:11] And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 22:12] And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 22:14] So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 22:15] And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell
[Fourth Book of the Kings 22:18] But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 22:20] Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:1] And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:2] And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:3] And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:4] And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:5] And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:6] And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:7] And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:8] And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:9] Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:10] And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:11] And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:12] And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:13] And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:14] And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:15] Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:16] And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:17] Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:18] And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:19] And all the houses also of the high places that were in the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:20] And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:21] And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:22] Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:24] Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:25] And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:26] Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:27] And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:28] Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:29] In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:30] And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:31] Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign;
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:32] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:33] And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:34] And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:35] And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:36] Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign;
[Fourth Book of the Kings 23:37] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:1] In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:2] And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:3] Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:5] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:6] So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:7] And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land:
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:8] Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:9] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:10] At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:11] And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:12] And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:13] And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:14] And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:15] And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king’s
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:16] And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:17] And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father’s brother king
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:18] Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:19] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 24:20] For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:1] And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:2] And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:3] And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:4] And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:5] And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:6] So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:7] And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:8] And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:10] And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:11] Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:12] But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:13] And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:14] And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:15] And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:16] The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:17] The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:18] And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:22] And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:23] And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men,
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:24] And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:25] But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:26] And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:27] And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
[Fourth Book of the Kings 25:30] And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the

[First Book of the Chronicles 12:17] And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:18] Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains,
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:19] And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:20] As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:21] And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:22] For at that time day by day there came to David to help him,
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:23] And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:24] The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:25] Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war,
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:26] Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:27] And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:29] And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:30] And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:31] And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:32] And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:33] Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:34] And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:35] And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:36] And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:37] And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:38] All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:39] And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking:
[First Book of the Chronicles 12:40] Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and
[First Book of the Chronicles 13:1] And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds,
[First Book of the Chronicles 13:2] And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem
[First Book of the Chronicles 13:3] And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired
[First Book of the Chronicles 13:4] And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the
[First Book of the Chronicles 13:5] So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even
[First Book of the Chronicles 13:6] And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to
[First Book of the Chronicles 13:7] And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of
[First Book of the Chronicles 13:8] And David and all Israel played before God with all their might,
[First Book of the Chronicles 13:9] And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put
[First Book of the Chronicles 13:10] And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote
[First Book of the Chronicles 13:11] And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach
[First Book of the Chronicles 13:12] And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring
[First Book of the Chronicles 13:14] And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his
[First Book of the Chronicles 14:1] Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of
[First Book of the Chronicles 14:2] And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over
[First Book of the Chronicles 14:3] And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons
[First Book of the Chronicles 14:4] Now these are the names of his children which he had in
[First Book of the Chronicles 14:8] And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over
[First Book of the Chronicles 14:9] And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of
[First Book of the Chronicles 14:10] And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the
[First Book of the Chronicles 14:11] So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then
[First Book of the Chronicles 14:12] And when they had left their gods there, David gave a
[First Book of the Chronicles 14:13] And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the
[First Book of the Chronicles 14:14] Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go
[First Book of the Chronicles 14:15] And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the
[First Book of the Chronicles 14:16] David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the
[First Book of the Chronicles 14:17] And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:1] And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:2] Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:3] And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:4] And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: 15:5
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:11] And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:13] For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:14] So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:15] And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:16] And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:17] So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:19] So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:22] And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:23] And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:24] And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:25] So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:26] And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:27] And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:28] Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD
[First Book of the Chronicles 15:29] And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:1] So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:2] And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:3] And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:4] And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:7] Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:8] Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:9] Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:10] Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:11] Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:12] Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders,
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:14] He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:15] Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:20] And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:23] Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:24] Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:25] For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:26] For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:27] Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:28] Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:29] Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:30] Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable,
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:31] Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:32] Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:33] Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:34] O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:35] And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:36] Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:37] So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD
[First Book of the Chronicles 16:43] And all the people departed every man to his house: and David
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:1] Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:2] Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:3] And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:6] Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:9] Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:11] And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:12] He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:13] I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:15] According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:16] And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:18] What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant?
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:19] O LORD, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:20] O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:21] And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:23] Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:24] Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:25] For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build
[First Book of the Chronicles 17:26] And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness
[First Book of the Chronicles 18:1] Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines,
[First Book of the Chronicles 18:2] And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David’s servants, and
[First Book of the Chronicles 18:3] And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went
[First Book of the Chronicles 18:4] And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand
[First Book of the Chronicles 18:5] And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of
[First Book of the Chronicles 18:6] Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became
[First Book of the Chronicles 18:7] And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
[First Book of the Chronicles 18:8] Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer,
[First Book of the Chronicles 18:9] Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the
[First Book of the Chronicles 18:11] Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver
[First Book of the Chronicles 18:12] Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the
[First Book of the Chronicles 18:13] And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became
[First Book of the Chronicles 18:14] So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and
[First Book of the Chronicles 18:15] And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
[First Book of the Chronicles 18:16] And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar,
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:1] Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:2] And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:3] But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:5] Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served.
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:6] And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:7] So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:8] And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:9] And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:10] Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:11] And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:12] And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:13] Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:14] So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:15] And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:16] And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:17] And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:18] But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the
[First Book of the Chronicles 19:19] And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the
[First Book of the Chronicles 20:1] And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time
[First Book of the Chronicles 20:2] And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and
[First Book of the Chronicles 20:3] And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with
[First Book of the Chronicles 20:4] And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer
[First Book of the Chronicles 20:5] And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son
[First Book of the Chronicles 20:6] And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great
[First Book of the Chronicles 20:7] But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s
[First Book of the Chronicles 20:8] These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:1] And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:2] And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go,
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:3] And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:5] And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:6] But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:7] And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:8] And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:9] And the LORD spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying, 21:10 Go and
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:11] So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:13] And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:14] So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:15] And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:16] And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:17] And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:18] Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:19] And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:20] And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:21] And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:22] Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:23] And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:24] And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:25] So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:26] And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:27] And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:28] At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:29] For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the
[First Book of the Chronicles 21:30] But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was
[First Book of the Chronicles 22:1] Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is
[First Book of the Chronicles 22:2] And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in
[First Book of the Chronicles 22:3] And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors
[First Book of the Chronicles 22:5] And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house
[First Book of the Chronicles 22:6] Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an
[First Book of the Chronicles 22:7] And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind
[First Book of the Chronicles 22:9] Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest;
[First Book of the Chronicles 22:10] He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and
[First Book of the Chronicles 22:11] Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build
[First Book of the Chronicles 22:12] Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee
[First Book of the Chronicles 22:13] Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the
[First Book of the Chronicles 22:14] Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the
[First Book of the Chronicles 22:15] Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and
[First Book of the Chronicles 22:16] Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is
[First Book of the Chronicles 22:17] David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon
[First Book of the Chronicles 22:19] Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God;
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:1] So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:2] And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:3] Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:4] Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:5] Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:6] And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi,
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:7] Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:8] The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel,
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:9] The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three.
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:10] And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:11] And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:12] The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:13] The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated,
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:14] Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:15] The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:16] Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:17] And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:18] Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.

[First Book of the Chronicles 23:20] Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:21] The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli;
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:22] And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:23] The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:24] These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers;
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:25] For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his
[First Book of the Chronicles 23:27] For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from
[First Book of the Chronicles 24:1] Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of
[First Book of the Chronicles 24:2] But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no
[First Book of the Chronicles 24:3] And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar,
[First Book of the Chronicles 24:4] And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than
[First Book of the Chronicles 24:5] Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the
[First Book of the Chronicles 24:6] And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites,
[First Book of the Chronicles 24:7] Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
[First Book of the Chronicles 24:8] The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 24:9 The fifth to
[First Book of the Chronicles 24:12] The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, 24:13 The
[First Book of the Chronicles 24:19] These were the orderings of them in their service to come into
[First Book of the Chronicles 24:20] And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of

[First Book of the Chronicles 24:27] The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and
[First Book of the Chronicles 24:28] Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.
[First Book of the Chronicles 24:29] Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.
[First Book of the Chronicles 24:30] The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These
[First Book of the Chronicles 24:31] These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of
[First Book of the Chronicles 25:1] Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the
[First Book of the Chronicles 25:3] Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and
[First Book of the Chronicles 25:4] Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel,
[First Book of the Chronicles 25:6] All these were under the hands of their father for song in the
[First Book of the Chronicles 25:7] So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed
[First Book of the Chronicles 25:8] And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as the
[First Book of the Chronicles 25:9] Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to

[First Book of the Chronicles 26:4] Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn,
[First Book of the Chronicles 26:5] Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth: for
[First Book of the Chronicles 26:6] Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout
[First Book of the Chronicles 26:7] The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad,
[First Book of the Chronicles 26:8] All these of the sons of Obededom: they and their sons and their

[First Book of the Chronicles 26:10] Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the

[First Book of the Chronicles 26:19] These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore,
[First Book of the Chronicles 26:20] And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house
[First Book of the Chronicles 26:21] As concerning the sons of Laadan; the sons of the Gershonite

[First Book of the Chronicles 26:26] Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of
[First Book of the Chronicles 26:27] Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain
[First Book of the Chronicles 26:28] And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and
[First Book of the Chronicles 26:29] Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward
[First Book of the Chronicles 26:30] And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of
[First Book of the Chronicles 26:31] Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the
[First Book of the Chronicles 26:32] And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:1] Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the chief
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:2] Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:3] Of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of the
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:4] And over the course of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite, and
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:5] The third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah the
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:6] This is that Benaiah, who was mighty among the thirty, and above
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:7] The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:8] The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite:
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:9] The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:10] The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:11] The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:12] The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:13] The tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:14] The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:15] The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:16] Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:23] But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:24] Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not,
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:25] And over the king’s treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and
[First Book of the Chronicles 27:32] Also Jonathan David’s uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and a
[First Book of the Chronicles 28:1] And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the
[First Book of the Chronicles 28:2] Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my
[First Book of the Chronicles 28:4] Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of
[First Book of the Chronicles 28:6] And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and
[First Book of the Chronicles 28:7] Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant
[First Book of the Chronicles 28:8] Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the
[First Book of the Chronicles 28:9] And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and
[First Book of the Chronicles 28:10] Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house
[First Book of the Chronicles 28:11] Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and
[First Book of the Chronicles 28:14] He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all
[First Book of the Chronicles 28:15] Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their
[First Book of the Chronicles 28:16] And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for
[First Book of the Chronicles 28:19] All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by
[First Book of the Chronicles 28:20] And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good
[First Book of the Chronicles 28:21] And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:1] Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation,
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:2] Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:3] Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God,
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:4] Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:8] And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:9] Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:10] Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation:
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:11] Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:12] Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all;
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:13] Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:14] But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:15] For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:16] O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:17] I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:18] O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:20] And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:21] And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:23] Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:24] And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:25] And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:26] Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:27] And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:28] And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour:
[First Book of the Chronicles 29:29] Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:1] And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:2] Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:3] So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:4] But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:5] Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:6] And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:7] In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:8] And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:9] Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:10] Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:13] Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:14] And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:15] And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:16] And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:17] And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for
[Second Book of the Chronicles 2:1] And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 2:2] And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear
[Second Book of the Chronicles 2:3] And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst
[Second Book of the Chronicles 2:4] Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 2:5] And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above
[Second Book of the Chronicles 2:6] But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 2:8] Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 2:10] And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut
[Second Book of the Chronicles 2:11] Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 2:12] Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made
[Second Book of the Chronicles 2:13] And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 2:15] Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 2:17] And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 2:18] And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:1] Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:2] And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:3] Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:4] And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:5] And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:6] And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:7] He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:8] And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:9] And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:10] And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:11] And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:12] And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:13] The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:14] And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:15] Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:16] And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads
[Second Book of the Chronicles 3:17] And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:1] Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:2] Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:3] And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:4] It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:5] And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:6] He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:7] And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:8] He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:9] Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:10] And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:11] And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:14] He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases; 4:15 One
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:16] The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:17] In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:18] Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:19] And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:20] Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:1] Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:2] Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:3] Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:4] And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:5] And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:6] Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:7] And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:9] And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:10] There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:11] And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:1] Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:2] But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:3] And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:4] And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:7] Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:8] But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:10] The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken:
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:11] And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:12] And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:14] And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:16] Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:17] Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:18] But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:21] Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:22] If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:23] Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:24] And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:25] Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:26] When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:28] If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:32] Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:34] If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:36] If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:40] Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:41] Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:42] O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:1] Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:2] And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:3] And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:4] Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:5] And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:6] And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:7] Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:8] Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:9] And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:10] And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:11] Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king’s
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:12] And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:13] If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:14] If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:15] Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:16] For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:17] And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:19] But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:21] And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:1] And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:3] And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:4] And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:5] Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:7] As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:9] But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:10] And these were the chief of king Solomon’s officers, even two
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:11] And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:12] Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:14] And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:15] And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:16] Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:17] Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:18] And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:1] And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:2] And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:3] And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:5] And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:7] Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:8] Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:9] And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:10] And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:11] And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:12] And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:13] Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:15] And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:16] And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:17] Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:18] And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:20] And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:21] For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram:
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:22] And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:23] And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:24] And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:25] And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:26] And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:27] And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:28] And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:29] Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:31] And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:1] And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:2] And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:3] And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:5] And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:6] And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:8] But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:9] And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:11] For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:12] So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:13] And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:15] So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:16] And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:17] But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:18] Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:19] And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
[Second Book of the Chronicles 11:1] And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house
[Second Book of the Chronicles 11:2] But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 11:3] Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all
[Second Book of the Chronicles 11:5] And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in
[Second Book of the Chronicles 11:6] He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, 11:7 And Bethzur,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 11:11] And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 11:12] And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made
[Second Book of the Chronicles 11:13] And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted
[Second Book of the Chronicles 11:14] For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 11:16] And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their
[Second Book of the Chronicles 11:17] So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 11:18] And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son
[Second Book of the Chronicles 11:19] Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
[Second Book of the Chronicles 11:20] And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which
[Second Book of the Chronicles 11:21] And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 11:23] And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children
[Second Book of the Chronicles 12:1] And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 12:2] And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam
[Second Book of the Chronicles 12:4] And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came
[Second Book of the Chronicles 12:5] Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 12:6] Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves;
[Second Book of the Chronicles 12:7] And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 12:8] Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my
[Second Book of the Chronicles 12:9] So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away
[Second Book of the Chronicles 12:10] Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 12:11] And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard
[Second Book of the Chronicles 12:12] And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from
[Second Book of the Chronicles 12:13] So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned:
[Second Book of the Chronicles 12:14] And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 12:15] Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written
[Second Book of the Chronicles 12:16] And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:1] Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:2] He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:3] And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:4] And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:7] And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:8] And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:9] Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:10] But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:12] And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:13] But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:14] And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:15] Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:16] And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:17] And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:18] Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:19] And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:20] Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:21] But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat
[Second Book of the Chronicles 13:22] And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 14:1] So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city
[Second Book of the Chronicles 14:2] And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD
[Second Book of the Chronicles 14:5] Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places
[Second Book of the Chronicles 14:6] And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 14:7] Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make
[Second Book of the Chronicles 14:8] And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 14:9] And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host
[Second Book of the Chronicles 14:10] Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array
[Second Book of the Chronicles 14:11] And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is
[Second Book of the Chronicles 14:12] So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;
[Second Book of the Chronicles 14:13] And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto
[Second Book of the Chronicles 14:14] And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 14:15] They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:1] And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded: 15:2 And
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:3] Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:4] But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:5] And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:6] And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:7] Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:8] And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:9] And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:10] So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:11] And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:12] And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:14] And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:15] And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:16] And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:17] But the high places were not taken away out of Israel:
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:18] And he brought into the house of God the things that his father
[Second Book of the Chronicles 15:19] And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 16:1] In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 16:2] Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 16:4] And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 16:5] And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off
[Second Book of the Chronicles 16:6] Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 16:7] And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 16:8] Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very
[Second Book of the Chronicles 16:9] For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole
[Second Book of the Chronicles 16:10] Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house;
[Second Book of the Chronicles 16:11] And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are
[Second Book of the Chronicles 16:12] And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased
[Second Book of the Chronicles 16:13] And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth
[Second Book of the Chronicles 16:14] And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:1] And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:2] And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:3] And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:5] Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:6] And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:7] Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:8] And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:9] And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:10] And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:11] Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:12] And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:13] And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:14] And these are the numbers of them according to the house of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:15] And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:16] And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:17] And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:18] And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 17:19] These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:1] Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:2] And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:3] And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:4] And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:5] Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:6] But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:8] And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:9] And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:10] And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:11] And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:12] And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:13] And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:14] And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:15] And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:16] Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:17] And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:19] And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:20] Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:22] Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:23] Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:25] Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:26] And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:27] And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:28] So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:29] And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:30] Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:31] And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:32] For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:33] And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 18:34] And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel
[Second Book of the Chronicles 19:1] And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace
[Second Book of the Chronicles 19:2] And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 19:3] Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou
[Second Book of the Chronicles 19:4] And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through
[Second Book of the Chronicles 19:5] And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 19:7] Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 19:8] Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 19:9] And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 19:10] And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that
[Second Book of the Chronicles 19:11] And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:1] It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:2] Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:3] And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:4] And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD:
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:5] And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:10] And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:11] Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:12] O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:13] And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:14] Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:16] To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:17] Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:18] And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:19] And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:20] And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:21] And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:22] And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:23] For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:24] And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:25] And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:26] And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:27] Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:28] And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:29] And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:30] So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:31] And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:32] And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:33] Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:34] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:35] And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with
[Second Book of the Chronicles 20:37] Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against
[Second Book of the Chronicles 21:1] Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 21:2] And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 21:3] And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 21:4] Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he
[Second Book of the Chronicles 21:5] Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 21:6] And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 21:7] Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 21:8] In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 21:9] Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots
[Second Book of the Chronicles 21:10] So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this
[Second Book of the Chronicles 21:11] Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 21:12] And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 21:16] Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 21:18] And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an
[Second Book of the Chronicles 21:19] And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 21:20] Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he
[Second Book of the Chronicles 22:1] And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son
[Second Book of the Chronicles 22:2] Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 22:3] He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother
[Second Book of the Chronicles 22:4] Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 22:5] He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son
[Second Book of the Chronicles 22:6] And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds
[Second Book of the Chronicles 22:7] And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for
[Second Book of the Chronicles 22:8] And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon
[Second Book of the Chronicles 22:9] And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in
[Second Book of the Chronicles 22:10] But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
[Second Book of the Chronicles 22:11] But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son
[Second Book of the Chronicles 22:12] And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:1] And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:2] And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:3] And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:4] This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:6] But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:7] And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:8] So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:9] Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:10] And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:11] Then they brought out the king’s son, and put upon him the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:12] Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:13] And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:14] Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:15] So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:16] And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:17] Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:18] Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:19] And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:20] And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 23:21] And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:1] Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:2] And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:3] And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:4] And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:5] And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:6] And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:8] And at the king’s commandment they made a chest, and set it
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:9] And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:10] And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:11] Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:12] And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:13] So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:14] And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:15] But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:16] And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:17] Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:18] And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:19] Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD;
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:20] And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:21] And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:22] Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:23] And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:24] For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:25] And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:26] And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 24:27] Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:1] Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:2] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:3] Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:4] But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:5] Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:6] He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:7] But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:8] But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God shall
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:9] And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:10] Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:11] And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:12] And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:13] But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:14] Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:15] Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:17] Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:18] And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:19] Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:21] So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:22] And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:23] And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:24] And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:25] And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:26] Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are
[Second Book of the Chronicles 25:28] And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:1] Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:2] He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:3] Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:4] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:5] And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:6] And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:7] And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:8] And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:9] Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:10] Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:11] Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:12] The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:13] And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:14] And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:15] And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:16] But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:17] And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:19] Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:20] And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:21] And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:22] Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah
[Second Book of the Chronicles 26:23] So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 27:1] Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 27:2] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 27:3] He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall
[Second Book of the Chronicles 27:4] Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 27:5] He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed
[Second Book of the Chronicles 27:6] So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 27:7] Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 27:8] He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 27:9] And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:1] Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:3] Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:4] He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:5] Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:6] For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:7] And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king’s
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:8] And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:9] But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:10] And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:12] Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:14] So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:15] And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:16] At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:17] For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:18] The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:19] For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel;
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:20] And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:21] For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:22] And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:23] For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him:
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:24] And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:25] And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:26] Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 28:27] And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:1] Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:2] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:3] He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:4] And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:6] For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:7] Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:8] Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:9] For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:10] Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:11] My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:12] Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:13] And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:15] And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:16] And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:17] Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:18] Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:19] Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:20] Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:21] And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:22] So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:23] And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:24] And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:25] And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:26] And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:27] And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:28] And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:29] And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:30] Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:31] Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:32] And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:33] And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:34] But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:35] And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 29:36] And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:1] And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:2] For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:3] For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:4] And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:5] So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:6] So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:7] And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:8] Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:9] For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:10] So the posts passed from city to city through the country of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:11] Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:12] Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:13] And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:14] And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:15] Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:16] And they stood in their place after their manner, according to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:17] For there were many in the congregation that were not
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:18] For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:20] And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:21] And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:22] And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:23] And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days:
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:24] For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:25] And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:26] So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 30:27] Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 31:1] Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went
[Second Book of the Chronicles 31:2] And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites
[Second Book of the Chronicles 31:3] He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 31:4] Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give
[Second Book of the Chronicles 31:5] And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 31:6] And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in
[Second Book of the Chronicles 31:7] In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 31:8] And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they
[Second Book of the Chronicles 31:9] Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites
[Second Book of the Chronicles 31:10] And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 31:11] Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 31:13] And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 31:14] And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 31:15] And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 31:20] And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that
[Second Book of the Chronicles 31:21] And in every work that he began in the service of the house of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:1] After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:2] And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:4] So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:5] Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:6] And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:9] After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:11] Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:17] He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:18] Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ speech unto the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:19] And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:20] And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:21] And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:22] Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:23] And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:24] In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:25] But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:26] Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:27] And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:29] Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:30] This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:31] Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:32] Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 32:33] And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:1] Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:3] For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:4] Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:5] And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:6] And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:7] And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:9] So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:10] And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:11] Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:12] And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:14] Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:15] And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:16] And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:17] Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:18] Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:19] His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:20] So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:21] Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:22] But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:24] And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own
[Second Book of the Chronicles 33:25] But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:1] Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:2] And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:3] For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:4] And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:5] And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:6] And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:7] And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:8] Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:9] And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:10] And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:11] Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:12] And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:13] Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:14] And when they brought out the money that was brought into the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:15] And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:16] And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:17] And they have gathered together the money that was found in the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:18] Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:19] And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:20] And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:22] And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:23] And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:26] And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:28] Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:29] Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:30] And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:31] And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:32] And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 34:33] And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:1] Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:2] And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:5] And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:6] So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:7] And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:8] And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:9] Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:10] So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:11] And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:12] And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:13] And they roasted the passover with fire according to the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:14] And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:15] And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:16] So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:17] And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:18] And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:19] In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:20] After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:21] But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:22] Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:23] And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:24] His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:25] And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 35:26] Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:1] Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:2] Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:3] And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:4] And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:5] Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:6] Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:7] Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:8] Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:9] Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:10] And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:11] Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:12] And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:13] And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:14] Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:15] And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:17] Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:18] And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:19] And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:20] And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 36:22] Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:1] Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:3] Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:4] And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:5] Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:6] And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:7] Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 1:9] And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a

[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:11] This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:12] Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:13] Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:14] Now because we have maintenance from the king’s palace, and it
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:16] We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:17] Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:18] The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:19] And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:20] There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:21] Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:22] Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow
[Second Book of the Chronicles 4:24] Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem.
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:1] Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:2] Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:3] At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:6] The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:8] Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:9] Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:11] And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:12] But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:13] But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:14] And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:16] Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 5:17] Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:1] Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:2] And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:3] In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:6] Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:8] Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:9] And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:11] Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:12] And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:13] Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:14] And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:15] And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:16] And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:17] And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:18] And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:19] And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:20] For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 6:21] And the children of Israel, which were come again out of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:1] Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:7] And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:8] And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:9] For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:10] For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:11] Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:12] Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:13] I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:14] Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:18] And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:19] The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:20] And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:21] And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:23] Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:25] And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:26] And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 7:27] Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:1] These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:2] Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel:
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:3] Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:4] Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:5] Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:6] Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:7] And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:8] And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:9] Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:10] And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:11] And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:12] And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:13] And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:14] Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:15] And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava;
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:16] Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:17] And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:18] And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:21] Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:22] For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:23] So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:24] Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:28] And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:29] Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:30] So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:31] Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:32] And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:33] Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:35] Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were
[Second Book of the Chronicles 8:36] And they delivered the king’s commissions unto the king’s
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:1] Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:2] For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:3] And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:4] Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:5] And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:7] Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:8] And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:9] For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:10] And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:12] Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither
[Second Book of the Chronicles 9:13] And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:1] Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:2] And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:3] Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:4] Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:5] Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:6] Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:7] And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:9] Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:10] And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:11] Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:12] Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:13] But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:14] Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:15] Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:16] And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:17] And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:18] And among the sons of the priests there were found that had
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:19] And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives;
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:20] And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:21] And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:22] And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:23] Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same

[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:25] Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:26] And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:27] And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:28] Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:29] And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub,

[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:43] Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau,
[Second Book of the Chronicles 10:44] All these had taken strange wives: and some of them had wives by
[Book of Nehemiah 1:1] The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass
[Book of Nehemiah 1:3] And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity
[Book of Nehemiah 1:4] And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and
[Book of Nehemiah 1:7] We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the
[Book of Nehemiah 1:8] Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy
[Book of Nehemiah 1:10] Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast
[Book of Nehemiah 1:11] O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the
[Book of Nehemiah 2:1] And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of
[Book of Nehemiah 2:2] Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad,
[Book of Nehemiah 2:5] And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy
[Book of Nehemiah 2:6] And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For
[Book of Nehemiah 2:7] Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters
[Book of Nehemiah 2:9] Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the
[Book of Nehemiah 2:10] When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
[Book of Nehemiah 2:11] So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
[Book of Nehemiah 2:12] And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither
[Book of Nehemiah 2:13] And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before
[Book of Nehemiah 2:14] Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king’s
[Book of Nehemiah 2:15] Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall,
[Book of Nehemiah 2:16] And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither
[Book of Nehemiah 2:17] Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how
[Book of Nehemiah 2:18] Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as
[Book of Nehemiah 2:19] But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
[Book of Nehemiah 3:1] Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the
[Book of Nehemiah 3:2] And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them
[Book of Nehemiah 3:3] But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid
[Book of Nehemiah 3:4] And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of
[Book of Nehemiah 3:5] And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not

[Book of Nehemiah 3:22] And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain.
[Book of Nehemiah 3:23] After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their house.
[Book of Nehemiah 3:24] After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from
[Book of Nehemiah 3:25] Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall, and
[Book of Nehemiah 3:26] Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over
[Book of Nehemiah 3:27] After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the
[Book of Nehemiah 3:28] From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over
[Book of Nehemiah 3:29] After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his

[Book of Nehemiah 3:31] After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith’s son unto the place of
[Book of Nehemiah 3:32] And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate
[Book of Nehemiah 4:1] But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the
[Book of Nehemiah 4:2] And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and
[Book of Nehemiah 4:4] Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon
[Book of Nehemiah 4:6] So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto
[Book of Nehemiah 4:7] But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the
[Book of Nehemiah 4:9] Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch
[Book of Nehemiah 4:10] And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is
[Book of Nehemiah 4:11] And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till
[Book of Nehemiah 4:12] And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came,
[Book of Nehemiah 4:13] Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the
[Book of Nehemiah 4:14] And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the
[Book of Nehemiah 4:15] And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known
[Book of Nehemiah 4:16] And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my
[Book of Nehemiah 4:17] They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with
[Book of Nehemiah 4:18] For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and
[Book of Nehemiah 4:19] And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of
[Book of Nehemiah 4:20] In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort
[Book of Nehemiah 4:21] So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from
[Book of Nehemiah 4:22] Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one
[Book of Nehemiah 4:23] So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of
[Book of Nehemiah 5:1] And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against
[Book of Nehemiah 5:2] For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are
[Book of Nehemiah 5:3] Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,
[Book of Nehemiah 5:4] There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s
[Book of Nehemiah 5:5] Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as
[Book of Nehemiah 5:6] And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
[Book of Nehemiah 5:7] Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the
[Book of Nehemiah 5:8] And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our
[Book of Nehemiah 5:9] Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in
[Book of Nehemiah 5:11] Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their
[Book of Nehemiah 5:12] Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of
[Book of Nehemiah 5:13] Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from
[Book of Nehemiah 5:14] Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor
[Book of Nehemiah 5:15] But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable
[Book of Nehemiah 5:16] Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we
[Book of Nehemiah 5:17] Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews
[Book of Nehemiah 5:18] Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six
[Book of Nehemiah 5:19] Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have
[Book of Nehemiah 6:1] Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the
[Book of Nehemiah 6:3] And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work,
[Book of Nehemiah 6:5] Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth
[Book of Nehemiah 6:7] And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at
[Book of Nehemiah 6:8] Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as
[Book of Nehemiah 6:9] For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened
[Book of Nehemiah 6:10] Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah
[Book of Nehemiah 6:11] And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that,
[Book of Nehemiah 6:12] And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he
[Book of Nehemiah 6:13] Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and
[Book of Nehemiah 6:14] My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these
[Book of Nehemiah 6:15] So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month
[Book of Nehemiah 6:16] And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and
[Book of Nehemiah 6:17] Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto
[Book of Nehemiah 6:18] For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the
[Book of Nehemiah 6:19] Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words
[Book of Nehemiah 7:1] Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the
[Book of Nehemiah 7:2] That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the
[Book of Nehemiah 7:3] And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened
[Book of Nehemiah 7:4] Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein,
[Book of Nehemiah 7:5] And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and
[Book of Nehemiah 7:9] The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.

[Book of Nehemiah 7:60] All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon’s servants, were
[Book of Nehemiah 7:61] And these were they which went up also from Telmelah, Telharesha,
[Book of Nehemiah 7:62] The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of
[Book of Nehemiah 7:63] And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz,
[Book of Nehemiah 7:64] These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
[Book of Nehemiah 7:65] And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the
[Book of Nehemiah 7:66] The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three
[Book of Nehemiah 7:68] Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two
[Book of Nehemiah 7:70] And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The
[Book of Nehemiah 7:71] And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the
[Book of Nehemiah 7:72] And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand
[Book of Nehemiah 7:73] So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the
[Book of Nehemiah 8:1] And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into
[Book of Nehemiah 8:2] And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both
[Book of Nehemiah 8:3] And he read therein before the street that was before the water
[Book of Nehemiah 8:4] And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had
[Book of Nehemiah 8:5] And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he
[Book of Nehemiah 8:7] Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai,
[Book of Nehemiah 8:8] So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave
[Book of Nehemiah 8:9] And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the
[Book of Nehemiah 8:10] Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the
[Book of Nehemiah 8:11] So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace,
[Book of Nehemiah 8:12] And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to
[Book of Nehemiah 8:13] And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the
[Book of Nehemiah 8:14] And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by
[Book of Nehemiah 8:16] So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves
[Book of Nehemiah 8:17] And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the
[Book of Nehemiah 8:18] Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in
[Book of Nehemiah 9:1] Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of
[Book of Nehemiah 9:2] And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers,
[Book of Nehemiah 9:3] And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law
[Book of Nehemiah 9:4] Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani,
[Book of Nehemiah 9:5] Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah,
[Book of Nehemiah 9:6] Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven
[Book of Nehemiah 9:7] Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest
[Book of Nehemiah 9:11] And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went
[Book of Nehemiah 9:12] Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in
[Book of Nehemiah 9:13] Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them
[Book of Nehemiah 9:16] But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks,
[Book of Nehemiah 9:18] Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy
[Book of Nehemiah 9:20] Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and
[Book of Nehemiah 9:21] Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so
[Book of Nehemiah 9:22] Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide
[Book of Nehemiah 9:23] Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and
[Book of Nehemiah 9:24] So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou
[Book of Nehemiah 9:25] And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses
[Book of Nehemiah 9:26] Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee,
[Book of Nehemiah 9:27] Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies,
[Book of Nehemiah 9:28] But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee:
[Book of Nehemiah 9:30] Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against
[Book of Nehemiah 9:31] Nevertheless for thy great mercies’ sake thou didst not utterly
[Book of Nehemiah 9:32] Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible
[Book of Nehemiah 9:33] Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou
[Book of Nehemiah 9:35] For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great
[Book of Nehemiah 9:36] Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou
[Book of Nehemiah 9:38] And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it;
[Book of Nehemiah 10:1] Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of
[Book of Nehemiah 10:9] And the Levites: both Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the
[Book of Nehemiah 10:14] The chief of the people; Parosh, Pahathmoab, Elam, Zatthu, Bani,
[Book of Nehemiah 10:15] Bunni, Azgad, Bebai, 10:16 Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin, 10:17 Ater,

[Book of Nehemiah 10:26] And Ahijah, Hanan, Anan, 10:27 Malluch, Harim, Baanah.
[Book of Nehemiah 10:28] And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the
[Book of Nehemiah 10:32] Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with
[Book of Nehemiah 10:33] For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for
[Book of Nehemiah 10:34] And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the
[Book of Nehemiah 10:35] And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits
[Book of Nehemiah 10:36] Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is
[Book of Nehemiah 10:38] And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when
[Book of Nehemiah 10:39] For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring
[Book of Nehemiah 11:1] And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of the
[Book of Nehemiah 11:2] And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered
[Book of Nehemiah 11:3] Now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem:
[Book of Nehemiah 11:4] And at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and of
[Book of Nehemiah 11:6] All the sons of Perez that dwelt at Jerusalem were four hundred
[Book of Nehemiah 11:7] And these are the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of Meshullam,
[Book of Nehemiah 11:8] And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight.
[Book of Nehemiah 11:9] And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer: and Judah the son
[Book of Nehemiah 11:10] Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin.
[Book of Nehemiah 11:11] Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of
[Book of Nehemiah 11:12] And their brethren that did the work of the house were eight
[Book of Nehemiah 11:13] And his brethren, chief of the fathers, two hundred forty and
[Book of Nehemiah 11:15] Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hashub, the son of
[Book of Nehemiah 11:17] And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of
[Book of Nehemiah 11:18] All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and
[Book of Nehemiah 11:19] Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren that
[Book of Nehemiah 11:20] And the residue of Israel, of the priests, and the Levites, were
[Book of Nehemiah 11:21] But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over
[Book of Nehemiah 11:22] The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son
[Book of Nehemiah 11:23] For it was the king’s commandment concerning them, that a
[Book of Nehemiah 11:24] And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah
[Book of Nehemiah 11:25] And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of
[Book of Nehemiah 11:28] And at Ziklag, and at Mekonah, and in the villages thereof,
[Book of Nehemiah 11:29] And at Enrimmon, and at Zareah, and at Jarmuth, 11:30 Zanoah,
[Book of Nehemiah 11:31] The children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelt at Michmash, and
[Book of Nehemiah 11:32] And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 11:33 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
[Book of Nehemiah 11:34] Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, 11:35 Lod, and Ono, the valley of
[Book of Nehemiah 11:36] And of the Levites were divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin.
[Book of Nehemiah 12:1] Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with
[Book of Nehemiah 12:2] Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, 12:3 Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, 12:4
[Book of Nehemiah 12:8] Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah,
[Book of Nehemiah 12:9] Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were over against them
[Book of Nehemiah 12:10] And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and
[Book of Nehemiah 12:12] And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the
[Book of Nehemiah 12:22] The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and
[Book of Nehemiah 12:23] The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the
[Book of Nehemiah 12:24] And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua
[Book of Nehemiah 12:25] Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub,
[Book of Nehemiah 12:26] These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of
[Book of Nehemiah 12:27] And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the
[Book of Nehemiah 12:28] And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both
[Book of Nehemiah 12:30] And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and
[Book of Nehemiah 12:31] Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and
[Book of Nehemiah 12:36] And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai,
[Book of Nehemiah 12:37] And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went
[Book of Nehemiah 12:38] And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against
[Book of Nehemiah 12:40] So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house
[Book of Nehemiah 12:43] Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for
[Book of Nehemiah 12:44] And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the
[Book of Nehemiah 12:45] And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God,
[Book of Nehemiah 12:46] For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of
[Book of Nehemiah 12:47] And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of
[Book of Nehemiah 13:1] On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the
[Book of Nehemiah 13:3] Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they
[Book of Nehemiah 13:4] And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the
[Book of Nehemiah 13:6] But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and
[Book of Nehemiah 13:8] And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household
[Book of Nehemiah 13:9] Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither
[Book of Nehemiah 13:10] And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been
[Book of Nehemiah 13:11] Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of
[Book of Nehemiah 13:12] Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine
[Book of Nehemiah 13:13] And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest,
[Book of Nehemiah 13:14] Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good
[Book of Nehemiah 13:15] In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the
[Book of Nehemiah 13:16] There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and
[Book of Nehemiah 13:17] Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them,
[Book of Nehemiah 13:18] Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this
[Book of Nehemiah 13:19] And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to
[Book of Nehemiah 13:20] So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without
[Book of Nehemiah 13:21] Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye
[Book of Nehemiah 13:22] And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves,
[Book of Nehemiah 13:23] In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod,
[Book of Nehemiah 13:25] And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of
[Book of Nehemiah 13:26] Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among
[Book of Nehemiah 13:27] Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to
[Book of Nehemiah 13:29] Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the
[Book of Nehemiah 13:30] Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards
[Book of Esther 1:1] Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus
[Book of Esther 1:5] And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all
[Book of Esther 1:7] And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being
[Book of Esther 1:8] And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so
[Book of Esther 1:9] Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal
[Book of Esther 1:10] On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with
[Book of Esther 1:12] But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by
[Book of Esther 1:13] Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so
[Book of Esther 1:17] For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so
[Book of Esther 1:18] Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto
[Book of Esther 1:19] If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him,
[Book of Esther 1:20] And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published
[Book of Esther 1:21] And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did
[Book of Esther 2:1] After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased,
[Book of Esther 2:2] Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there
[Book of Esther 2:5] Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was
[Book of Esther 2:7] And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter:
[Book of Esther 2:8] So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was
[Book of Esther 2:9] And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and
[Book of Esther 2:10] Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai
[Book of Esther 2:11] And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s
[Book of Esther 2:12] Now when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus,
[Book of Esther 2:14] In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the
[Book of Esther 2:15] Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of
[Book of Esther 2:16] So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in
[Book of Esther 2:17] And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained
[Book of Esther 2:18] Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his
[Book of Esther 2:19] And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then
[Book of Esther 2:20] Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai
[Book of Esther 2:21] In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the
[Book of Esther 2:22] And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the
[Book of Esther 2:23] And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out;
[Book of Esther 3:1] After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of
[Book of Esther 3:2] And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed,
[Book of Esther 3:3] Then the king’s servants, which were in the king’s gate, said unto
[Book of Esther 3:5] And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence,
[Book of Esther 3:6] And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had
[Book of Esther 3:7] In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year
[Book of Esther 3:8] And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people
[Book of Esther 3:9] If it please the king, let it be written that they may be
[Book of Esther 3:10] And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman
[Book of Esther 3:11] And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the
[Book of Esther 3:12] Then were the king’s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the
[Book of Esther 3:13] And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces,
[Book of Esther 3:14] The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
[Book of Esther 3:15] The posts went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and
[Book of Esther 4:1] When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his
[Book of Esther 4:3] And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and
[Book of Esther 4:4] So Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then
[Book of Esther 4:5] Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king’s chamberlains,
[Book of Esther 4:6] So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city,
[Book of Esther 4:7] And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of
[Book of Esther 4:8] Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was
[Book of Esther 4:9] And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
[Book of Esther 4:10] Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto
[Book of Esther 4:12] And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.
[Book of Esther 4:13] Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself
[Book of Esther 4:14] For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall
[Book of Esther 4:15] Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer, 4:16 Go,
[Book of Esther 4:17] So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther
[Book of Esther 5:1] Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal
[Book of Esther 5:2] And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the
[Book of Esther 5:3] Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and
[Book of Esther 5:4] And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king
[Book of Esther 5:5] Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as
[Book of Esther 5:6] And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy
[Book of Esther 5:7] Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is; 5:8
[Book of Esther 5:9] Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but
[Book of Esther 5:10] Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he
[Book of Esther 5:11] And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude
[Book of Esther 5:12] Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in
[Book of Esther 5:13] Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the
[Book of Esther 5:14] Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a
[Book of Esther 6:1] On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring
[Book of Esther 6:2] And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and
[Book of Esther 6:3] And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to
[Book of Esther 6:4] And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into
[Book of Esther 6:5] And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in
[Book of Esther 6:6] So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done
[Book of Esther 6:10] Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and
[Book of Esther 6:11] Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai,
[Book of Esther 6:12] And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to
[Book of Esther 6:13] And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing
[Book of Esther 6:14] And while they were yet talking with him, came the king’s
[Book of Esther 7:1] So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
[Book of Esther 7:2] And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the
[Book of Esther 7:3] Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in
[Book of Esther 7:5] Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen,
[Book of Esther 7:6] And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.
[Book of Esther 7:7] And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went
[Book of Esther 7:8] Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of
[Book of Esther 7:9] And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king,
[Book of Esther 7:10] So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
[Book of Esther 8:1] On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the
[Book of Esther 8:2] And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and
[Book of Esther 8:3] And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his
[Book of Esther 8:4] Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther
[Book of Esther 8:8] Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king’s name,
[Book of Esther 8:9] Then were the king’s scribes called at that time in the third
[Book of Esther 8:10] And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus’ name, and sealed it with the
[Book of Esther 8:13] The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
[Book of Esther 8:14] So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being
[Book of Esther 8:15] And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal
[Book of Esther 8:16] The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.
[Book of Esther 8:17] And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the
[Book of Esther 9:1] Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the
[Book of Esther 9:3] And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the
[Book of Esther 9:4] For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out
[Book of Esther 9:5] Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the
[Book of Esther 9:6] And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred
[Book of Esther 9:7] And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, 9:8 And Poratha, and
[Book of Esther 9:11] On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the
[Book of Esther 9:12] And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and
[Book of Esther 9:13] Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the
[Book of Esther 9:14] And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given
[Book of Esther 9:15] For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on
[Book of Esther 9:16] But the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces gathered
[Book of Esther 9:18] But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the
[Book of Esther 9:19] Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled
[Book of Esther 9:20] And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the
[Book of Esther 9:23] And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai
[Book of Esther 9:26] Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.
[Book of Esther 9:29] Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the
[Book of Esther 9:30] And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty
[Book of Esther 9:32] And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it
[Book of Esther 10:1] And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the
[Book of Esther 10:2] And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the
[Book of Job 1:1] There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that
[Book of Job 1:2] And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
[Book of Job 1:3] His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand
[Book of Job 1:4] And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day;
[Book of Job 1:5] And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about,
[Book of Job 1:6] Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
[Book of Job 1:7] And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan
[Book of Job 1:8] And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,
[Book of Job 1:11] But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he
[Book of Job 1:12] And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy
[Book of Job 1:13] And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating
[Book of Job 1:16] While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The
[Book of Job 1:17] While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The
[Book of Job 1:18] While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy
[Book of Job 1:20] Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and
[Book of Job 1:22] In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
[Book of Job 2:1] Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present
[Book of Job 2:2] And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan
[Book of Job 2:3] And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,
[Book of Job 2:4] And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all
[Book of Job 2:5] But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh,
[Book of Job 2:6] And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but
[Book of Job 2:7] So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job
[Book of Job 2:8] And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat
[Book of Job 2:9] Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine
[Book of Job 2:10] But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women
[Book of Job 2:11] Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come
[Book of Job 2:12] And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not,
[Book of Job 2:13] So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven
[Book of Job 3:1] After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
[Book of Job 3:2] And Job spake, and said, 3:3 Let the day perish wherein I was
[Book of Job 3:4] Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,
[Book of Job 3:5] Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell
[Book of Job 3:6] As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be
[Book of Job 3:7] Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
[Book of Job 3:8] Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up
[Book of Job 3:9] Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for
[Book of Job 3:11] Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost
[Book of Job 3:14] With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate
[Book of Job 3:17] There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at
[Book of Job 3:18] There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the
[Book of Job 3:19] The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his
[Book of Job 3:20] Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto
[Book of Job 3:24] For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured
[Book of Job 3:25] For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that
[Book of Job 3:26] I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet
[Book of Job 4:1] Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 4:2 If we assay to
[Book of Job 4:4] Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast
[Book of Job 4:5] But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee,
[Book of Job 4:6] Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the
[Book of Job 4:9] By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils
[Book of Job 4:10] The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and
[Book of Job 4:11] The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s
[Book of Job 4:12] Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a
[Book of Job 4:13] In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep
[Book of Job 4:15] Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood
[Book of Job 4:21] Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die,
[Book of Job 5:1] Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of
[Book of Job 5:3] I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his
[Book of Job 5:4] His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the
[Book of Job 5:5] Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the
[Book of Job 5:6] Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth
[Book of Job 5:8] I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: 5:9
[Book of Job 5:12] He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands
[Book of Job 5:13] He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of
[Book of Job 5:14] They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday
[Book of Job 5:15] But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from
[Book of Job 5:16] So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
[Book of Job 5:17] Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise
[Book of Job 5:19] He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall
[Book of Job 5:20] In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the
[Book of Job 5:21] Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt
[Book of Job 5:22] At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be
[Book of Job 5:23] For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the
[Book of Job 5:24] And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and
[Book of Job 5:25] Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine
[Book of Job 5:26] Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of
[Book of Job 5:27] Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it
[Book of Job 6:1] But Job answered and said, 6:2 Oh that my grief were throughly
[Book of Job 6:4] For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof
[Book of Job 6:5] Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over
[Book of Job 6:8] Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the
[Book of Job 6:11] What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end,
[Book of Job 6:15] My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream
[Book of Job 6:18] The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and
[Book of Job 6:19] The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for
[Book of Job 6:20] They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither,
[Book of Job 6:21] For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.
[Book of Job 6:22] Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your
[Book of Job 6:25] How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
[Book of Job 6:26] Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is
[Book of Job 6:28] Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto
[Book of Job 6:29] Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my
[Book of Job 6:30] Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse
[Book of Job 7:4] When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone?
[Book of Job 7:5] My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is
[Book of Job 7:6] My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without
[Book of Job 7:7] O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.
[Book of Job 7:8] The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes
[Book of Job 7:9] As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down
[Book of Job 7:10] He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place
[Book of Job 7:11] Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the
[Book of Job 7:12] Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me? 7:13
[Book of Job 7:16] I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days
[Book of Job 7:17] What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou
[Book of Job 8:1] Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 8:2 How long wilt thou
[Book of Job 8:7] Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly
[Book of Job 8:8] For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself
[Book of Job 8:13] So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s hope
[Book of Job 8:15] He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall
[Book of Job 8:16] He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his
[Book of Job 8:17] His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of
[Book of Job 8:18] If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying,
[Book of Job 8:19] Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall
[Book of Job 8:20] Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he
[Book of Job 8:22] They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling
[Book of Job 9:1] Then Job answered and said, 9:2 I know it is so of a truth: but
[Book of Job 9:4] He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened
[Book of Job 9:6] Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof
[Book of Job 9:7] Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the
[Book of Job 9:8] Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves
[Book of Job 9:9] Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of
[Book of Job 9:10] Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders
[Book of Job 9:11] Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I
[Book of Job 9:12] Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto
[Book of Job 9:14] How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to
[Book of Job 9:16] If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe
[Book of Job 9:17] For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds
[Book of Job 9:18] He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with
[Book of Job 9:19] If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who
[Book of Job 9:21] Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would
[Book of Job 9:22] This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect
[Book of Job 9:23] If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the
[Book of Job 9:24] The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the
[Book of Job 9:26] They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that
[Book of Job 9:27] If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my
[Book of Job 9:29] If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? 9:30 If I wash myself
[Book of Job 9:32] For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we
[Book of Job 9:33] Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand
[Book of Job 9:34] Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify
[Book of Job 10:1] My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon
[Book of Job 10:2] I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou
[Book of Job 10:3] Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou
[Book of Job 10:8] Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about;
[Book of Job 10:9] Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and
[Book of Job 10:12] Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath
[Book of Job 10:13] And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this
[Book of Job 10:14] If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from
[Book of Job 10:15] If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I
[Book of Job 10:17] Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine
[Book of Job 10:18] Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh
[Book of Job 10:20] Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may
[Book of Job 11:1] Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 11:2 Should not
[Book of Job 11:5] But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; 11:6
[Book of Job 11:7] Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the
[Book of Job 11:10] If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can
[Book of Job 11:13] If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward
[Book of Job 11:15] For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou
[Book of Job 11:18] And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt
[Book of Job 11:19] Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea,
[Book of Job 11:20] But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not
[Book of Job 12:1] And Job answered and said, 12:2 No doubt but ye are the people,
[Book of Job 12:3] But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to
[Book of Job 12:5] He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in
[Book of Job 12:6] The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are
[Book of Job 12:7] But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls
[Book of Job 12:9] Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath
[Book of Job 12:11] Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat? 12:12
[Book of Job 12:13] With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and
[Book of Job 12:14] Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he
[Book of Job 12:15] Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he
[Book of Job 12:16] With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver
[Book of Job 12:17] He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges
[Book of Job 12:18] He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a
[Book of Job 12:19] He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.
[Book of Job 12:20] He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the
[Book of Job 12:21] He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of
[Book of Job 12:22] He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to
[Book of Job 12:23] He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the
[Book of Job 12:24] He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the
[Book of Job 12:25] They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to
[Book of Job 13:1] Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and
[Book of Job 13:2] What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto
[Book of Job 13:3] Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with
[Book of Job 13:4] But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.
[Book of Job 13:5] O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your
[Book of Job 13:6] Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
[Book of Job 13:7] Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
[Book of Job 13:8] Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God? 13:9 Is it
[Book of Job 13:11] Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall
[Book of Job 13:13] Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on
[Book of Job 13:14] Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in
[Book of Job 13:16] He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come
[Book of Job 13:17] Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
[Book of Job 13:18] Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be
[Book of Job 13:19] Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue,
[Book of Job 13:20] Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from
[Book of Job 13:21] Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me
[Book of Job 13:22] Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer
[Book of Job 13:23] How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my
[Book of Job 13:24] Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?
[Book of Job 13:25] Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue
[Book of Job 13:27] Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly
[Book of Job 13:28] And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth
[Book of Job 14:1] Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.
[Book of Job 14:2] He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as
[Book of Job 14:3] And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me
[Book of Job 14:5] Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with
[Book of Job 14:7] For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will
[Book of Job 14:8] Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock
[Book of Job 14:10] But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,
[Book of Job 14:13] O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest
[Book of Job 14:15] Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire
[Book of Job 14:16] For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my
[Book of Job 14:18] And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rock
[Book of Job 14:19] The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which
[Book of Job 14:20] Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou
[Book of Job 14:21] His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are
[Book of Job 14:22] But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him
[Book of Job 15:1] Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 15:2 Should a wise
[Book of Job 15:5] For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the
[Book of Job 15:6] Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips
[Book of Job 15:7] Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before
[Book of Job 15:11] Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret
[Book of Job 15:16] How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh
[Book of Job 15:20] The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number
[Book of Job 15:21] A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer
[Book of Job 15:22] He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is
[Book of Job 15:23] He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth
[Book of Job 15:24] Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail
[Book of Job 15:25] For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth
[Book of Job 15:26] He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of
[Book of Job 15:28] And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man
[Book of Job 15:29] He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
[Book of Job 15:30] He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his
[Book of Job 15:31] Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall
[Book of Job 15:32] It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall
[Book of Job 15:33] He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast
[Book of Job 15:34] For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire
[Book of Job 15:35] They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly
[Book of Job 16:1] Then Job answered and said, 16:2 I have heard many such things:
[Book of Job 16:3] Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou
[Book of Job 16:5] But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my
[Book of Job 16:6] Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear,
[Book of Job 16:8] And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against
[Book of Job 16:9] He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me
[Book of Job 16:10] They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me
[Book of Job 16:11] God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into
[Book of Job 16:12] I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken
[Book of Job 16:13] His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins
[Book of Job 16:14] He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like
[Book of Job 16:15] I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the
[Book of Job 16:16] My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of
[Book of Job 16:18] O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.
[Book of Job 16:19] Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on
[Book of Job 16:20] My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.
[Book of Job 16:21] O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for
[Book of Job 17:1] My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready
[Book of Job 17:2] Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in
[Book of Job 17:5] He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his
[Book of Job 17:6] He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was
[Book of Job 17:7] Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are
[Book of Job 17:8] Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall
[Book of Job 17:9] The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean
[Book of Job 17:10] But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot
[Book of Job 17:11] My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts
[Book of Job 17:12] They change the night into day: the light is short because of
[Book of Job 17:13] If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the
[Book of Job 17:14] I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou
[Book of Job 17:15] And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
[Book of Job 17:16] They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest
[Book of Job 18:1] Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 18:2 How long will it
[Book of Job 18:3] Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your
[Book of Job 18:5] Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of
[Book of Job 18:6] The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall
[Book of Job 18:7] The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own
[Book of Job 18:8] For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a
[Book of Job 18:9] The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail
[Book of Job 18:10] The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in
[Book of Job 18:11] Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him
[Book of Job 18:12] His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be
[Book of Job 18:13] It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of
[Book of Job 18:14] His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it
[Book of Job 18:15] It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his:
[Book of Job 18:16] His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch
[Book of Job 18:17] His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have
[Book of Job 18:18] He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of
[Book of Job 18:19] He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any
[Book of Job 18:20] They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they
[Book of Job 18:21] Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the
[Book of Job 19:1] Then Job answered and said, 19:2 How long will ye vex my soul,
[Book of Job 19:4] And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with
[Book of Job 19:5] If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead
[Book of Job 19:7] Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but
[Book of Job 19:8] He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set
[Book of Job 19:9] He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my
[Book of Job 19:10] He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope
[Book of Job 19:11] He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me
[Book of Job 19:12] His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and
[Book of Job 19:13] He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are
[Book of Job 19:14] My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten
[Book of Job 19:15] They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a
[Book of Job 19:16] I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him
[Book of Job 19:17] My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the
[Book of Job 19:18] Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against
[Book of Job 19:19] All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are
[Book of Job 19:20] My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped
[Book of Job 19:21] Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the
[Book of Job 19:22] Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my
[Book of Job 19:28] But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the
[Book of Job 20:1] Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 20:2 Therefore do
[Book of Job 20:3] I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my
[Book of Job 20:4] Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,
[Book of Job 20:5] That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the
[Book of Job 20:9] The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall
[Book of Job 20:10] His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall
[Book of Job 20:11] His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down
[Book of Job 20:12] Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under
[Book of Job 20:15] He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again:
[Book of Job 20:16] He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay
[Book of Job 20:17] He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and
[Book of Job 20:18] That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not
[Book of Job 20:19] Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he
[Book of Job 20:21] There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man
[Book of Job 20:22] In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every
[Book of Job 20:23] When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of
[Book of Job 20:24] He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall
[Book of Job 20:25] It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering
[Book of Job 20:26] All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown
[Book of Job 20:27] The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise
[Book of Job 20:28] The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow
[Book of Job 20:29] This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage
[Book of Job 21:1] But Job answered and said, 21:2 Hear diligently my speech, and
[Book of Job 21:3] Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock
[Book of Job 21:4] As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should
[Book of Job 21:6] Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my
[Book of Job 21:7] Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in
[Book of Job 21:9] Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon
[Book of Job 21:10] Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and
[Book of Job 21:11] They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their
[Book of Job 21:12] They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the
[Book of Job 21:13] They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the
[Book of Job 21:14] Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not
[Book of Job 21:15] What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit
[Book of Job 21:17] How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh
[Book of Job 21:18] They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm
[Book of Job 21:19] God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him,
[Book of Job 21:20] His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the
[Book of Job 21:21] For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the
[Book of Job 21:23] One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
[Book of Job 21:24] His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with
[Book of Job 21:25] And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never
[Book of Job 21:26] They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover
[Book of Job 21:27] Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye
[Book of Job 21:28] For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the
[Book of Job 21:31] Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him
[Book of Job 21:33] The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man
[Book of Job 21:34] How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there
[Book of Job 22:7] Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast
[Book of Job 22:8] But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable
[Book of Job 22:9] Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless
[Book of Job 22:10] Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth
[Book of Job 22:12] Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the
[Book of Job 22:15] Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
[Book of Job 22:16] Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown
[Book of Job 22:19] The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them
[Book of Job 22:20] Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them
[Book of Job 22:21] Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good
[Book of Job 22:22] Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his
[Book of Job 22:23] If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou
[Book of Job 22:24] Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as
[Book of Job 22:25] Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have
[Book of Job 22:26] For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt
[Book of Job 22:27] Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and
[Book of Job 22:28] Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto
[Book of Job 22:29] When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting
[Book of Job 22:30] He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered
[Book of Job 23:1] Then Job answered and said, 23:2 Even to day is my complaint
[Book of Job 23:3] Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to
[Book of Job 23:5] I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand
[Book of Job 23:6] Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would
[Book of Job 23:7] There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be
[Book of Job 23:8] Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I
[Book of Job 23:11] My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not
[Book of Job 23:12] Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I
[Book of Job 23:13] But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul
[Book of Job 23:14] For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many
[Book of Job 23:15] Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am
[Book of Job 23:16] For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:
[Book of Job 23:17] Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he
[Book of Job 24:1] Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that
[Book of Job 24:3] They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s
[Book of Job 24:4] They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide
[Book of Job 24:5] Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work;
[Book of Job 24:6] They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the
[Book of Job 24:7] They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no
[Book of Job 24:8] They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the
[Book of Job 24:9] They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of
[Book of Job 24:10] They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away
[Book of Job 24:12] Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded
[Book of Job 24:13] They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not
[Book of Job 24:14] The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy,
[Book of Job 24:15] The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying,
[Book of Job 24:16] In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for
[Book of Job 24:17] For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one
[Book of Job 24:18] He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth:
[Book of Job 24:19] Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave
[Book of Job 24:20] The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him;
[Book of Job 24:21] He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not
[Book of Job 24:22] He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no
[Book of Job 24:23] Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet
[Book of Job 24:24] They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought
[Book of Job 24:25] And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my
[Book of Job 25:3] Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his
[Book of Job 25:6] How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a
[Book of Job 26:3] How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast
[Book of Job 26:6] Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.
[Book of Job 26:7] He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the
[Book of Job 26:8] He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is
[Book of Job 26:9] He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud
[Book of Job 26:10] He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and
[Book of Job 26:11] The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
[Book of Job 26:12] He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he
[Book of Job 26:13] By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath
[Book of Job 26:14] Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is
[Book of Job 27:3] All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my
[Book of Job 27:5] God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not
[Book of Job 27:6] My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart
[Book of Job 27:7] Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me
[Book of Job 27:8] For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,
[Book of Job 27:12] Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus
[Book of Job 27:14] If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his
[Book of Job 27:15] Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his
[Book of Job 27:16] Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the
[Book of Job 27:18] He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper
[Book of Job 27:19] The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he
[Book of Job 27:20] Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away
[Book of Job 27:21] The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a
[Book of Job 27:22] For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee
[Book of Job 27:23] Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his
[Book of Job 28:1] Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where
[Book of Job 28:2] Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the
[Book of Job 28:3] He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection:
[Book of Job 28:4] The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters
[Book of Job 28:5] As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned
[Book of Job 28:6] The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of
[Book of Job 28:7] There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture’s
[Book of Job 28:9] He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the
[Book of Job 28:10] He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every
[Book of Job 28:11] He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is
[Book of Job 28:12] But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of
[Book of Job 28:14] The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not
[Book of Job 28:15] It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed
[Book of Job 28:16] It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious
[Book of Job 28:17] The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it
[Book of Job 28:18] No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price
[Book of Job 28:19] The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be
[Book of Job 28:20] Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of
[Book of Job 28:22] Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with
[Book of Job 28:23] God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place
[Book of Job 28:24] For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the
[Book of Job 28:26] When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning
[Book of Job 28:28] And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is
[Book of Job 29:1] Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 29:2 Oh that I were
[Book of Job 29:8] The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and
[Book of Job 29:9] The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their
[Book of Job 29:10] The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the
[Book of Job 29:11] When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw
[Book of Job 29:13] The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I
[Book of Job 29:14] I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a
[Book of Job 29:15] I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.
[Book of Job 29:16] I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I
[Book of Job 29:17] And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of
[Book of Job 29:18] Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my
[Book of Job 29:19] My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night
[Book of Job 29:20] My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
[Book of Job 29:21] Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my
[Book of Job 29:22] After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon
[Book of Job 29:23] And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their
[Book of Job 29:24] If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my
[Book of Job 29:25] I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the
[Book of Job 30:1] But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose
[Book of Job 30:2] Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom
[Book of Job 30:4] Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their
[Book of Job 30:5] They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as
[Book of Job 30:7] Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were
[Book of Job 30:8] They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were
[Book of Job 30:9] And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.
[Book of Job 30:10] They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in
[Book of Job 30:11] Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also
[Book of Job 30:12] Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and
[Book of Job 30:13] They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no
[Book of Job 30:14] They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the
[Book of Job 30:15] Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and
[Book of Job 30:16] And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction
[Book of Job 30:17] My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews
[Book of Job 30:18] By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it
[Book of Job 30:19] He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and
[Book of Job 30:20] I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou
[Book of Job 30:21] Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest
[Book of Job 30:22] Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it,
[Book of Job 30:23] For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house
[Book of Job 30:24] Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though
[Book of Job 30:25] Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul
[Book of Job 30:27] My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction
[Book of Job 30:28] I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the
[Book of Job 30:29] I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
[Book of Job 30:30] My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
[Book of Job 30:31] My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice
[Book of Job 31:1] I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a
[Book of Job 31:7] If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked
[Book of Job 31:9] If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid
[Book of Job 31:11] For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be
[Book of Job 31:12] For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root
[Book of Job 31:13] If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my
[Book of Job 31:15] Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one
[Book of Job 31:20] If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with
[Book of Job 31:23] For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of
[Book of Job 31:24] If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou
[Book of Job 31:29] If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted
[Book of Job 31:31] If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his
[Book of Job 31:32] The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors
[Book of Job 31:33] If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity
[Book of Job 31:36] Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown
[Book of Job 31:37] I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince
[Book of Job 31:38] If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof
[Book of Job 32:1] So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous
[Book of Job 32:2] Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the
[Book of Job 32:3] Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because
[Book of Job 32:4] Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder
[Book of Job 32:5] When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these
[Book of Job 32:6] And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am
[Book of Job 32:7] I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach
[Book of Job 32:8] But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty
[Book of Job 32:9] Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand
[Book of Job 32:10] Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
[Book of Job 32:11] Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons,
[Book of Job 32:12] Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you
[Book of Job 32:14] Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I
[Book of Job 32:15] They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
[Book of Job 32:16] When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and
[Book of Job 32:18] For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
[Book of Job 32:19] Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to
[Book of Job 32:20] I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and
[Book of Job 32:21] Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me
[Book of Job 32:22] For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker
[Book of Job 33:1] Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all
[Book of Job 33:2] Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my
[Book of Job 33:3] My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips
[Book of Job 33:4] The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty
[Book of Job 33:5] If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand
[Book of Job 33:6] Behold, I am according to thy wish in God’s stead: I also am
[Book of Job 33:7] Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my
[Book of Job 33:8] Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the
[Book of Job 33:10] Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his
[Book of Job 33:12] Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God
[Book of Job 33:13] Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of
[Book of Job 33:14] For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
[Book of Job 33:15] In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth
[Book of Job 33:18] He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from
[Book of Job 33:19] He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude
[Book of Job 33:21] His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his
[Book of Job 33:22] Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the
[Book of Job 33:23] If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a
[Book of Job 33:25] His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to
[Book of Job 33:27] He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and
[Book of Job 33:29] Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, 33:30 To
[Book of Job 33:31] Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will
[Book of Job 33:32] If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to
[Book of Job 33:33] If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee
[Book of Job 34:1] Furthermore Elihu answered and said, 34:2 Hear my words, O ye
[Book of Job 34:3] For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
[Book of Job 34:4] Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is
[Book of Job 34:5] For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my
[Book of Job 34:6] Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without
[Book of Job 34:7] What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water? 34:8
[Book of Job 34:9] For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should
[Book of Job 34:10] Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it
[Book of Job 34:11] For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every
[Book of Job 34:12] Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty
[Book of Job 34:13] Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed
[Book of Job 34:16] If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice
[Book of Job 34:17] Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn
[Book of Job 34:20] In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at
[Book of Job 34:21] For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his
[Book of Job 34:22] There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of
[Book of Job 34:23] For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should
[Book of Job 34:24] He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set
[Book of Job 34:25] Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the
[Book of Job 34:26] He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
[Book of Job 34:27] Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of
[Book of Job 34:29] When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he
[Book of Job 34:31] Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne
[Book of Job 34:33] Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it,
[Book of Job 34:34] Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken
[Book of Job 34:35] Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without
[Book of Job 34:36] My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his
[Book of Job 34:37] For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands
[Book of Job 35:1] Elihu spake moreover, and said, 35:2 Thinkest thou this to be
[Book of Job 35:5] Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are
[Book of Job 35:6] If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy
[Book of Job 35:9] By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed
[Book of Job 35:10] But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the
[Book of Job 35:13] Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty
[Book of Job 35:14] Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is
[Book of Job 35:15] But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet
[Book of Job 36:1] Elihu also proceeded, and said, 36:2 Suffer me a little, and I
[Book of Job 36:3] I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe
[Book of Job 36:4] For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in
[Book of Job 36:5] Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in
[Book of Job 36:6] He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the
[Book of Job 36:7] He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings
[Book of Job 36:8] And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of
[Book of Job 36:10] He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that
[Book of Job 36:11] If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in
[Book of Job 36:12] But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they
[Book of Job 36:13] But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he
[Book of Job 36:14] They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
[Book of Job 36:15] He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears
[Book of Job 36:16] Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a
[Book of Job 36:17] But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and
[Book of Job 36:18] Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his
[Book of Job 36:19] Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of
[Book of Job 36:20] Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
[Book of Job 36:21] Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather
[Book of Job 36:22] Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? 36:23
[Book of Job 36:25] Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
[Book of Job 36:26] Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the
[Book of Job 36:27] For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain
[Book of Job 36:29] Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the
[Book of Job 36:31] For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
[Book of Job 36:32] With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to
[Book of Job 36:33] The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also
[Book of Job 37:1] At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.
[Book of Job 37:2] Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth
[Book of Job 37:3] He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto
[Book of Job 37:4] After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his
[Book of Job 37:5] God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth
[Book of Job 37:6] For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the
[Book of Job 37:7] He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his
[Book of Job 37:8] Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.
[Book of Job 37:9] Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.
[Book of Job 37:10] By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the
[Book of Job 37:11] Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his
[Book of Job 37:13] He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land,
[Book of Job 37:14] Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous
[Book of Job 37:15] Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of
[Book of Job 37:17] How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the
[Book of Job 37:20] Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he
[Book of Job 37:21] And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but
[Book of Job 37:22] Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible
[Book of Job 37:23] Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent
[Book of Job 37:24] Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise
[Book of Job 38:1] Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 38:2
[Book of Job 38:4] Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
[Book of Job 38:5] Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath
[Book of Job 38:8] Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it
[Book of Job 38:15] And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm
[Book of Job 38:16] Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou
[Book of Job 38:18] Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou
[Book of Job 38:19] Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness,
[Book of Job 38:31] Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the
[Book of Job 39:1] Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring
[Book of Job 39:4] Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they
[Book of Job 39:5] Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands
[Book of Job 39:7] He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the
[Book of Job 39:8] The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after
[Book of Job 39:9] Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
[Book of Job 39:10] Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will
[Book of Job 39:16] She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not
[Book of Job 39:18] What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse
[Book of Job 39:19] Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck
[Book of Job 39:21] He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth
[Book of Job 39:22] He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he
[Book of Job 39:23] The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the
[Book of Job 39:24] He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither
[Book of Job 39:25] He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle
[Book of Job 39:26] Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward
[Book of Job 39:29] From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.
[Book of Job 39:30] Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are,
[Book of Job 40:1] Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, 40:2 Shall he that
[Book of Job 40:3] Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 40:4 Behold, I am vile;
[Book of Job 40:5] Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will
[Book of Job 40:6] Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
[Book of Job 40:7] Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and
[Book of Job 40:8] Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that
[Book of Job 40:11] Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is
[Book of Job 40:12] Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread
[Book of Job 40:13] Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.
[Book of Job 40:14] Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can
[Book of Job 40:15] Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as
[Book of Job 40:16] Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the
[Book of Job 40:17] He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are
[Book of Job 40:18] His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars
[Book of Job 40:19] He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make
[Book of Job 40:20] Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts
[Book of Job 40:21] He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and
[Book of Job 40:22] The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the
[Book of Job 40:23] Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth
[Book of Job 40:24] He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
[Book of Job 41:1] Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a
[Book of Job 41:9] Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down
[Book of Job 41:12] I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely
[Book of Job 41:13] Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him
[Book of Job 41:15] His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.
[Book of Job 41:16] One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
[Book of Job 41:17] They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they
[Book of Job 41:18] By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the
[Book of Job 41:19] Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
[Book of Job 41:20] Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or
[Book of Job 41:21] His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
[Book of Job 41:22] In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy
[Book of Job 41:23] The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in
[Book of Job 41:24] His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the
[Book of Job 41:25] When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of
[Book of Job 41:26] The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the
[Book of Job 41:27] He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.
[Book of Job 41:28] The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him
[Book of Job 41:29] Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a
[Book of Job 41:30] Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things
[Book of Job 41:31] He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a
[Book of Job 41:32] He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to
[Book of Job 41:33] Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
[Book of Job 41:34] He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children
[Book of Job 42:1] Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 42:2 I know that thou canst
[Book of Job 42:3] Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I
[Book of Job 42:4] Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee,
[Book of Job 42:5] I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye
[Book of Job 42:6] Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.
[Book of Job 42:7] And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto
[Book of Job 42:8] Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go
[Book of Job 42:9] So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the
[Book of Job 42:10] And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his
[Book of Job 42:11] Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters,
[Book of Job 42:12] So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his
[Book of Job 42:13] He had also seven sons and three daughters.
[Book of Job 42:14] And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the
[Book of Job 42:15] And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters
[Book of Job 42:16] After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his
[Book of Job 42:17] So Job died, being old and full of days.
[Book of Psalms 1:1] Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,
[Book of Psalms 1:2] But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he
[Book of Psalms 1:3] And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that
[Book of Psalms 1:4] The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind
[Book of Psalms 1:5] Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners
[Book of Psalms 1:6] For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the
[Book of Psalms 2:1] Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
[Book of Psalms 2:2] The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
[Book of Psalms 2:3] Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from
[Book of Psalms 2:4] He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have
[Book of Psalms 2:5] Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his
[Book of Psalms 2:6] Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
[Book of Psalms 2:7] I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my
[Book of Psalms 2:8] Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine
[Book of Psalms 2:9] Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in
[Book of Psalms 2:10] Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of
[Book of Psalms 2:11] Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
[Book of Psalms 2:12] Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when
[Book of Psalms 3:1] Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that
[Book of Psalms 3:2] Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in
[Book of Psalms 3:3] But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up
[Book of Psalms 3:4] I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his
[Book of Psalms 3:5] I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
[Book of Psalms 3:6] I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set
[Book of Psalms 3:7] Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine
[Book of Psalms 3:8] Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy
[Book of Psalms 4:1] Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged
[Book of Psalms 4:2] O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how
[Book of Psalms 4:3] But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for
[Book of Psalms 4:4] Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your
[Book of Psalms 4:5] Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the
[Book of Psalms 4:6] There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou
[Book of Psalms 4:7] Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that
[Book of Psalms 4:8] I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only
[Book of Psalms 5:1] Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
[Book of Psalms 5:2] Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto
[Book of Psalms 5:3] My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning
[Book of Psalms 5:4] For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither
[Book of Psalms 5:5] The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers
[Book of Psalms 5:6] Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor
[Book of Psalms 5:7] But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy
[Book of Psalms 5:8] Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;
[Book of Psalms 5:9] For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is
[Book of Psalms 5:10] Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels;
[Book of Psalms 5:11] But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them
[Book of Psalms 5:12] For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou
[Book of Psalms 6:1] O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy
[Book of Psalms 6:2] Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my
[Book of Psalms 6:3] My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?
[Book of Psalms 6:4] Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake.
[Book of Psalms 6:5] For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who
[Book of Psalms 6:6] I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim;
[Book of Psalms 6:7] Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of
[Book of Psalms 6:8] Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath
[Book of Psalms 6:9] The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my
[Book of Psalms 6:10] Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return
[Book of Psalms 7:1] O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them
[Book of Psalms 7:2] Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while
[Book of Psalms 7:3] O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my
[Book of Psalms 7:4] If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea,
[Book of Psalms 7:5] Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread
[Book of Psalms 7:6] Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage
[Book of Psalms 7:7] So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for
[Book of Psalms 7:8] The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my
[Book of Psalms 7:9] Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish
[Book of Psalms 7:10] My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.
[Book of Psalms 7:11] God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every
[Book of Psalms 7:12] If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and
[Book of Psalms 7:13] He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he
[Book of Psalms 7:14] Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief,
[Book of Psalms 7:15] He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which
[Book of Psalms 7:16] His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent
[Book of Psalms 7:17] I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will
[Book of Psalms 8:1] O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who
[Book of Psalms 8:2] Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
[Book of Psalms 8:3] When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and
[Book of Psalms 8:4] What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man,
[Book of Psalms 8:5] For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast
[Book of Psalms 8:6] Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou
[Book of Psalms 8:7] All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
[Book of Psalms 8:8] The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever
[Book of Psalms 8:9] O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
[Book of Psalms 9:1] I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth
[Book of Psalms 9:2] I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy
[Book of Psalms 9:3] When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at
[Book of Psalms 9:4] For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the
[Book of Psalms 9:5] Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked,
[Book of Psalms 9:6] O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou
[Book of Psalms 9:7] But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne
[Book of Psalms 9:8] And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister
[Book of Psalms 9:9] The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in
[Book of Psalms 9:10] And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for
[Book of Psalms 9:11] Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among
[Book of Psalms 9:12] When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he
[Book of Psalms 9:13] Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of
[Book of Psalms 9:14] That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter
[Book of Psalms 9:15] The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net
[Book of Psalms 9:16] The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked
[Book of Psalms 9:17] The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that
[Book of Psalms 9:18] For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of
[Book of Psalms 9:19] Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in
[Book of Psalms 9:20] Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to
[Book of Psalms 10:1] Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in
[Book of Psalms 10:2] The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be
[Book of Psalms 10:3] For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and blesseth the
[Book of Psalms 10:4] The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek
[Book of Psalms 10:5] His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of
[Book of Psalms 10:6] He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall
[Book of Psalms 10:7] His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his
[Book of Psalms 10:8] He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret
[Book of Psalms 10:9] He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait
[Book of Psalms 10:10] He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by
[Book of Psalms 10:11] He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his
[Book of Psalms 10:12] Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.
[Book of Psalms 10:13] Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his
[Book of Psalms 10:14] Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to
[Book of Psalms 10:15] Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his
[Book of Psalms 10:16] The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out
[Book of Psalms 10:17] LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt
[Book of Psalms 10:18] To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the
[Book of Psalms 11:1] In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird
[Book of Psalms 11:2] For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow
[Book of Psalms 11:3] If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
[Book of Psalms 11:4] The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD’s throne is in heaven:
[Book of Psalms 11:5] The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth
[Book of Psalms 11:6] Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an
[Book of Psalms 11:7] For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth
[Book of Psalms 12:1] Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from
[Book of Psalms 12:2] They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering
[Book of Psalms 12:3] The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that
[Book of Psalms 12:4] Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our
[Book of Psalms 12:5] For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now
[Book of Psalms 12:6] The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a
[Book of Psalms 12:7] Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this
[Book of Psalms 12:8] The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
[Book of Psalms 13:1] How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt
[Book of Psalms 13:2] How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my
[Book of Psalms 13:3] Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I
[Book of Psalms 13:4] Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that
[Book of Psalms 13:5] But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy
[Book of Psalms 13:6] I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with
[Book of Psalms 14:1] The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are
[Book of Psalms 14:2] The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see
[Book of Psalms 14:3] They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy:
[Book of Psalms 14:4] Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
[Book of Psalms 14:5] There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of
[Book of Psalms 14:6] Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his
[Book of Psalms 14:7] Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the
[Book of Psalms 15:1] Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy
[Book of Psalms 15:2] He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and
[Book of Psalms 15:3] He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his
[Book of Psalms 15:4] In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them
[Book of Psalms 15:5] He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward
[Book of Psalms 16:1] Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
[Book of Psalms 16:2] O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my
[Book of Psalms 16:3] But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in
[Book of Psalms 16:4] Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god:
[Book of Psalms 16:5] The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou
[Book of Psalms 16:6] The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a
[Book of Psalms 16:7] I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also
[Book of Psalms 16:8] I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right
[Book of Psalms 16:9] Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also
[Book of Psalms 16:10] For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou
[Book of Psalms 16:11] Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness
[Book of Psalms 17:1] Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my
[Book of Psalms 17:2] Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes
[Book of Psalms 17:3] Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night;
[Book of Psalms 17:4] Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept
[Book of Psalms 17:5] Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.
[Book of Psalms 17:6] I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline
[Book of Psalms 17:7] Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy
[Book of Psalms 17:8] Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy
[Book of Psalms 17:9] From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who
[Book of Psalms 17:10] They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak
[Book of Psalms 17:11] They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their
[Book of Psalms 17:12] Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a
[Book of Psalms 17:13] Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul
[Book of Psalms 17:14] From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,
[Book of Psalms 17:15] As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be
[Book of Psalms 18:1] I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.
[Book of Psalms 18:2] The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God,
[Book of Psalms 18:3] I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall
[Book of Psalms 18:4] The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men
[Book of Psalms 18:5] The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death
[Book of Psalms 18:6] In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he
[Book of Psalms 18:7] Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the
[Book of Psalms 18:8] There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
[Book of Psalms 18:9] He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under
[Book of Psalms 18:10] And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the
[Book of Psalms 18:11] He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him
[Book of Psalms 18:12] At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed,
[Book of Psalms 18:13] The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his
[Book of Psalms 18:14] Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out
[Book of Psalms 18:15] Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of
[Book of Psalms 18:16] He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
[Book of Psalms 18:17] He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated
[Book of Psalms 18:18] They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my
[Book of Psalms 18:19] He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,
[Book of Psalms 18:20] The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to
[Book of Psalms 18:21] For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
[Book of Psalms 18:22] For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his
[Book of Psalms 18:23] I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine
[Book of Psalms 18:24] Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my
[Book of Psalms 18:25] With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an
[Book of Psalms 18:26] With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward
[Book of Psalms 18:27] For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down
[Book of Psalms 18:28] For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my
[Book of Psalms 18:29] For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I
[Book of Psalms 18:30] As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried:
[Book of Psalms 18:31] For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?
[Book of Psalms 18:32] It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way
[Book of Psalms 18:33] He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, and setteth me upon my high
[Book of Psalms 18:34] He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by
[Book of Psalms 18:35] Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
[Book of Psalms 18:36] Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
[Book of Psalms 18:37] I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I
[Book of Psalms 18:38] I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are
[Book of Psalms 18:39] For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast
[Book of Psalms 18:40] Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might
[Book of Psalms 18:41] They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD,
[Book of Psalms 18:42] Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did
[Book of Psalms 18:43] Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and
[Book of Psalms 18:44] As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers
[Book of Psalms 18:45] The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close
[Book of Psalms 18:46] The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my
[Book of Psalms 18:47] It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.
[Book of Psalms 18:48] He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up
[Book of Psalms 18:49] Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
[Book of Psalms 18:50] Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to
[Book of Psalms 19:1] The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth
[Book of Psalms 19:2] Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
[Book of Psalms 19:3] There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
[Book of Psalms 19:4] Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to
[Book of Psalms 19:5] Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth
[Book of Psalms 19:6] His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit
[Book of Psalms 19:7] The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the
[Book of Psalms 19:8] The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the
[Book of Psalms 19:9] The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments
[Book of Psalms 19:10] More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:
[Book of Psalms 19:11] Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them
[Book of Psalms 19:12] Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
[Book of Psalms 19:13] Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not
[Book of Psalms 19:14] Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
[Book of Psalms 20:1] The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of
[Book of Psalms 20:2] Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of
[Book of Psalms 20:3] Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
[Book of Psalms 20:4] Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy
[Book of Psalms 20:5] We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we
[Book of Psalms 20:6] Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him
[Book of Psalms 20:7] Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember
[Book of Psalms 20:8] They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand
[Book of Psalms 20:9] Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
[Book of Psalms 21:1] The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation
[Book of Psalms 21:2] Thou hast given him his heart’s desire, and hast not withholden
[Book of Psalms 21:3] For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou
[Book of Psalms 21:4] He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of
[Book of Psalms 21:5] His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou
[Book of Psalms 21:6] For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him
[Book of Psalms 21:7] For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the
[Book of Psalms 21:8] Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall
[Book of Psalms 21:9] Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger:
[Book of Psalms 21:10] Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed
[Book of Psalms 21:11] For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous
[Book of Psalms 21:12] Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt
[Book of Psalms 21:13] Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing
[Book of Psalms 22:1] My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far
[Book of Psalms 22:2] O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the
[Book of Psalms 22:3] But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
[Book of Psalms 22:4] Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver
[Book of Psalms 22:5] They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee,
[Book of Psalms 22:6] But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of
[Book of Psalms 22:7] All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip,
[Book of Psalms 22:8] He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver
[Book of Psalms 22:9] But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me
[Book of Psalms 22:10] I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my
[Book of Psalms 22:11] Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to
[Book of Psalms 22:12] Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset
[Book of Psalms 22:13] They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a
[Book of Psalms 22:14] I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint:
[Book of Psalms 22:15] My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth
[Book of Psalms 22:16] For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have
[Book of Psalms 22:17] I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.
[Book of Psalms 22:18] They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.
[Book of Psalms 22:19] But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee
[Book of Psalms 22:20] Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the
[Book of Psalms 22:21] Save me from the lion’s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the
[Book of Psalms 22:22] I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the
[Book of Psalms 22:23] Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob,
[Book of Psalms 22:24] For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
[Book of Psalms 22:25] My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay
[Book of Psalms 22:26] The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD
[Book of Psalms 22:27] All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD:
[Book of Psalms 22:28] For the kingdom is the LORD’s: and he is the governor among the
[Book of Psalms 22:29] All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they
[Book of Psalms 22:30] A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a
[Book of Psalms 22:31] They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a
[Book of Psalms 23:1] The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
[Book of Psalms 23:2] He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside
[Book of Psalms 23:3] He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
[Book of Psalms 23:4] Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I
[Book of Psalms 23:5] Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
[Book of Psalms 23:6] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[Book of Psalms 24:1] The earth is the LORD’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and
[Book of Psalms 24:2] For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the
[Book of Psalms 24:3] Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in
[Book of Psalms 24:4] He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted
[Book of Psalms 24:5] He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness
[Book of Psalms 24:6] This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face,
[Book of Psalms 24:7] Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting
[Book of Psalms 24:8] Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD
[Book of Psalms 24:9] Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting
[Book of Psalms 24:10] Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of
[Book of Psalms 25:1] Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.
[Book of Psalms 25:2] O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine
[Book of Psalms 25:3] Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed
[Book of Psalms 25:4] Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.
[Book of Psalms 25:5] Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my
[Book of Psalms 25:6] Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses;
[Book of Psalms 25:7] Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
[Book of Psalms 25:8] Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in
[Book of Psalms 25:9] The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach
[Book of Psalms 25:10] All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep
[Book of Psalms 25:11] For thy name’s sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is
[Book of Psalms 25:12] What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the
[Book of Psalms 25:13] His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the
[Book of Psalms 25:14] The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will
[Book of Psalms 25:15] Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet
[Book of Psalms 25:16] Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and
[Book of Psalms 25:17] The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my
[Book of Psalms 25:18] Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.
[Book of Psalms 25:19] Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with
[Book of Psalms 25:20] O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put
[Book of Psalms 25:21] Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.
[Book of Psalms 25:22] Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
[Book of Psalms 26:1] Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have
[Book of Psalms 26:2] Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.
[Book of Psalms 26:3] For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in
[Book of Psalms 26:4] I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with
[Book of Psalms 26:5] I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit
[Book of Psalms 26:6] I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine
[Book of Psalms 26:7] That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of
[Book of Psalms 26:8] LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place
[Book of Psalms 26:9] Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:
[Book of Psalms 26:10] In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of
[Book of Psalms 26:11] But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be
[Book of Psalms 26:12] My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I
[Book of Psalms 27:1] The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
[Book of Psalms 27:2] When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to
[Book of Psalms 27:3] Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear:
[Book of Psalms 27:4] One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after;
[Book of Psalms 27:5] For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in
[Book of Psalms 27:6] And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round
[Book of Psalms 27:7] Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me,
[Book of Psalms 27:8] When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy
[Book of Psalms 27:9] Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger:
[Book of Psalms 27:10] When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take
[Book of Psalms 27:11] Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because
[Book of Psalms 27:12] Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false
[Book of Psalms 27:13] I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the
[Book of Psalms 27:14] Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
[Book of Psalms 28:1] Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest,
[Book of Psalms 28:2] Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I
[Book of Psalms 28:3] Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of
[Book of Psalms 28:4] Give them according to their deeds, and according to the
[Book of Psalms 28:5] Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation
[Book of Psalms 28:6] Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my
[Book of Psalms 28:7] The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him,
[Book of Psalms 28:8] The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his
[Book of Psalms 28:9] Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and
[Book of Psalms 29:1] Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and
[Book of Psalms 29:2] Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD
[Book of Psalms 29:3] The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory
[Book of Psalms 29:4] The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full
[Book of Psalms 29:5] The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh
[Book of Psalms 29:6] He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like
[Book of Psalms 29:7] The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.
[Book of Psalms 29:8] The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh
[Book of Psalms 29:9] The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth
[Book of Psalms 29:10] The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for
[Book of Psalms 29:11] The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless
[Book of Psalms 30:1] I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast
[Book of Psalms 30:2] O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
[Book of Psalms 30:3] O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast
[Book of Psalms 30:4] Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the
[Book of Psalms 30:5] For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life:
[Book of Psalms 30:6] And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.
[Book of Psalms 30:7] LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong:
[Book of Psalms 30:8] I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.
[Book of Psalms 30:9] What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?
[Book of Psalms 30:10] Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.
[Book of Psalms 30:11] Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put
[Book of Psalms 30:12] To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be
[Book of Psalms 31:1] In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed:
[Book of Psalms 31:2] Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong
[Book of Psalms 31:3] For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name’s
[Book of Psalms 31:4] Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for
[Book of Psalms 31:5] Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD
[Book of Psalms 31:6] I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the
[Book of Psalms 31:7] I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered
[Book of Psalms 31:8] And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set
[Book of Psalms 31:9] Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is
[Book of Psalms 31:10] For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my
[Book of Psalms 31:11] I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my
[Book of Psalms 31:12] I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken
[Book of Psalms 31:13] For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side:
[Book of Psalms 31:14] But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.
[Book of Psalms 31:15] My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine
[Book of Psalms 31:16] Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy
[Book of Psalms 31:17] Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let
[Book of Psalms 31:18] Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous
[Book of Psalms 31:19] Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
[Book of Psalms 31:20] Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the
[Book of Psalms 31:21] Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous
[Book of Psalms 31:22] For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:
[Book of Psalms 31:23] O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the
[Book of Psalms 31:24] Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye
[Book of Psalms 32:1] Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
[Book of Psalms 32:2] Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and
[Book of Psalms 32:3] When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all
[Book of Psalms 32:4] For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is
[Book of Psalms 32:5] I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid.
[Book of Psalms 32:6] For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time
[Book of Psalms 32:7] Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
[Book of Psalms 32:8] I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt
[Book of Psalms 32:9] Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
[Book of Psalms 32:10] Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the
[Book of Psalms 32:11] Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for
[Book of Psalms 33:1] Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the
[Book of Psalms 33:2] Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an
[Book of Psalms 33:3] Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.
[Book of Psalms 33:4] For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in
[Book of Psalms 33:5] He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the
[Book of Psalms 33:6] By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host
[Book of Psalms 33:7] He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth
[Book of Psalms 33:8] Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the
[Book of Psalms 33:9] For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.
[Book of Psalms 33:10] The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he
[Book of Psalms 33:11] The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his
[Book of Psalms 33:12] Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom
[Book of Psalms 33:13] The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.
[Book of Psalms 33:14] From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the
[Book of Psalms 33:15] He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their
[Book of Psalms 33:16] There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man
[Book of Psalms 33:17] An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver
[Book of Psalms 33:18] Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon
[Book of Psalms 33:19] To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in
[Book of Psalms 33:20] Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.
[Book of Psalms 33:21] For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in
[Book of Psalms 33:22] Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
[Book of Psalms 34:1] I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually
[Book of Psalms 34:2] My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear
[Book of Psalms 34:3] O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.
[Book of Psalms 34:4] I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my
[Book of Psalms 34:5] They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were
[Book of Psalms 34:6] This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of
[Book of Psalms 34:7] The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him,
[Book of Psalms 34:8] O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that
[Book of Psalms 34:9] O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that
[Book of Psalms 34:10] The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek
[Book of Psalms 34:11] Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of
[Book of Psalms 34:12] What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he
[Book of Psalms 34:13] Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
[Book of Psalms 34:14] Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
[Book of Psalms 34:15] The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are
[Book of Psalms 34:16] The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off
[Book of Psalms 34:17] The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out
[Book of Psalms 34:18] The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and
[Book of Psalms 34:19] Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD
[Book of Psalms 34:20] He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.
[Book of Psalms 34:21] Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous
[Book of Psalms 34:22] The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them
[Book of Psalms 35:1] Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight
[Book of Psalms 35:2] Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.
[Book of Psalms 35:3] Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that
[Book of Psalms 35:4] Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul:
[Book of Psalms 35:5] Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the
[Book of Psalms 35:6] Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD
[Book of Psalms 35:7] For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which
[Book of Psalms 35:8] Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that
[Book of Psalms 35:9] And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his
[Book of Psalms 35:10] All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which
[Book of Psalms 35:11] False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that
[Book of Psalms 35:12] They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.
[Book of Psalms 35:13] But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I
[Book of Psalms 35:14] I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I
[Book of Psalms 35:15] But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
[Book of Psalms 35:16] With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with
[Book of Psalms 35:17] Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their
[Book of Psalms 35:18] I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise
[Book of Psalms 35:19] Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:
[Book of Psalms 35:20] For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters
[Book of Psalms 35:21] Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha,
[Book of Psalms 35:22] This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not
[Book of Psalms 35:23] Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause,
[Book of Psalms 35:24] Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let
[Book of Psalms 35:25] Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let
[Book of Psalms 35:26] Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that
[Book of Psalms 35:27] Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous
[Book of Psalms 35:28] And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise
[Book of Psalms 36:1] The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there
[Book of Psalms 36:2] For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be
[Book of Psalms 36:3] The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off
[Book of Psalms 36:4] He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way
[Book of Psalms 36:5] Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness
[Book of Psalms 36:6] Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are
[Book of Psalms 36:7] How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the
[Book of Psalms 36:8] They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house;
[Book of Psalms 36:9] For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see
[Book of Psalms 36:10] O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy
[Book of Psalms 36:11] Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand
[Book of Psalms 36:12] There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down,
[Book of Psalms 37:1] Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious
[Book of Psalms 37:2] For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the
[Book of Psalms 37:3] Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land,
[Book of Psalms 37:4] Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the
[Book of Psalms 37:5] Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall
[Book of Psalms 37:6] And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy
[Book of Psalms 37:7] Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself
[Book of Psalms 37:8] Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise
[Book of Psalms 37:9] For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the
[Book of Psalms 37:10] For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou
[Book of Psalms 37:11] But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight
[Book of Psalms 37:12] The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with
[Book of Psalms 37:13] The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is
[Book of Psalms 37:14] The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to
[Book of Psalms 37:15] Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows
[Book of Psalms 37:16] A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of
[Book of Psalms 37:17] For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD
[Book of Psalms 37:18] The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance
[Book of Psalms 37:19] They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of
[Book of Psalms 37:20] But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall
[Book of Psalms 37:21] The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous
[Book of Psalms 37:22] For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they
[Book of Psalms 37:23] The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he
[Book of Psalms 37:24] Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD
[Book of Psalms 37:25] I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the
[Book of Psalms 37:26] He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.
[Book of Psalms 37:27] Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.
[Book of Psalms 37:28] For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they
[Book of Psalms 37:29] The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for
[Book of Psalms 37:30] The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue
[Book of Psalms 37:31] The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall
[Book of Psalms 37:32] The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
[Book of Psalms 37:33] The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he
[Book of Psalms 37:34] Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to
[Book of Psalms 37:35] I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself
[Book of Psalms 37:36] Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but
[Book of Psalms 37:37] Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of
[Book of Psalms 37:38] But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of
[Book of Psalms 37:39] But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their
[Book of Psalms 37:40] And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver
[Book of Psalms 38:1] O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot
[Book of Psalms 38:2] For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.
[Book of Psalms 38:3] There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither
[Book of Psalms 38:4] For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden
[Book of Psalms 38:5] My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.
[Book of Psalms 38:6] I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day
[Book of Psalms 38:7] For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no
[Book of Psalms 38:8] I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the
[Book of Psalms 38:9] Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid
[Book of Psalms 38:10] My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of
[Book of Psalms 38:11] My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my
[Book of Psalms 38:12] They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they
[Book of Psalms 38:13] But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that
[Book of Psalms 38:14] Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no
[Book of Psalms 38:15] For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.
[Book of Psalms 38:16] For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me:
[Book of Psalms 38:17] For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
[Book of Psalms 38:18] For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
[Book of Psalms 38:19] But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that
[Book of Psalms 38:20] They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;
[Book of Psalms 38:21] Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.
[Book of Psalms 38:22] Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
[Book of Psalms 39:1] I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
[Book of Psalms 39:2] I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my
[Book of Psalms 39:3] My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned:
[Book of Psalms 39:4] LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what
[Book of Psalms 39:5] Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is
[Book of Psalms 39:6] Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are
[Book of Psalms 39:7] And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.
[Book of Psalms 39:8] Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach
[Book of Psalms 39:9] I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.
[Book of Psalms 39:10] Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of
[Book of Psalms 39:11] When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou
[Book of Psalms 39:12] Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy
[Book of Psalms 39:13] O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and
[Book of Psalms 40:1] I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and
[Book of Psalms 40:2] He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
[Book of Psalms 40:3] And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God:
[Book of Psalms 40:4] Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and
[Book of Psalms 40:5] Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast
[Book of Psalms 40:6] Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou
[Book of Psalms 40:7] Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written
[Book of Psalms 40:8] I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
[Book of Psalms 40:9] I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I
[Book of Psalms 40:10] I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have
[Book of Psalms 40:11] Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy
[Book of Psalms 40:12] For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities
[Book of Psalms 40:13] Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help
[Book of Psalms 40:14] Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my
[Book of Psalms 40:15] Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto
[Book of Psalms 40:16] Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let
[Book of Psalms 40:17] But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art
[Book of Psalms 41:1] Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver
[Book of Psalms 41:2] The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be
[Book of Psalms 41:3] The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou
[Book of Psalms 41:4] I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have
[Book of Psalms 41:5] Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name
[Book of Psalms 41:6] And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth
[Book of Psalms 41:7] All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they
[Book of Psalms 41:8] An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that
[Book of Psalms 41:9] Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat
[Book of Psalms 41:10] But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I
[Book of Psalms 41:11] By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth
[Book of Psalms 41:12] And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest
[Book of Psalms 41:13] Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to
[Book of Psalms 42:1] As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul
[Book of Psalms 42:2] My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come
[Book of Psalms 42:3] My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually
[Book of Psalms 42:4] When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had
[Book of Psalms 42:5] Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in
[Book of Psalms 42:6] O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I
[Book of Psalms 42:7] Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy
[Book of Psalms 42:8] Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time, and
[Book of Psalms 42:9] I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I
[Book of Psalms 42:10] As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while
[Book of Psalms 42:11] Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
[Book of Psalms 43:1] Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O
[Book of Psalms 43:2] For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off?
[Book of Psalms 43:3] O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them
[Book of Psalms 43:4] Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy:
[Book of Psalms 43:5] Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
[Book of Psalms 44:1] We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us,
[Book of Psalms 44:2] How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst
[Book of Psalms 44:3] For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,
[Book of Psalms 44:4] Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.
[Book of Psalms 44:5] Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will
[Book of Psalms 44:6] For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
[Book of Psalms 44:7] But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to
[Book of Psalms 44:8] In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever.
[Book of Psalms 44:9] But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth
[Book of Psalms 44:10] Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate
[Book of Psalms 44:11] Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast
[Book of Psalms 44:12] Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy
[Book of Psalms 44:13] Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a
[Book of Psalms 44:14] Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head
[Book of Psalms 44:15] My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face
[Book of Psalms 44:16] For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason
[Book of Psalms 44:17] All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
[Book of Psalms 44:18] Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined
[Book of Psalms 44:19] Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and
[Book of Psalms 44:20] If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our
[Book of Psalms 44:21] Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the
[Book of Psalms 44:22] Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted
[Book of Psalms 44:23] Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for
[Book of Psalms 44:24] Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction
[Book of Psalms 44:25] For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto
[Book of Psalms 44:26] Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies’ sake.
[Book of Psalms 45:1] My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I
[Book of Psalms 45:2] Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into
[Book of Psalms 45:3] Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and
[Book of Psalms 45:4] And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and
[Book of Psalms 45:5] Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king’s enemies;
[Book of Psalms 45:6] Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy
[Book of Psalms 45:7] Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God,
[Book of Psalms 45:8] All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of
[Book of Psalms 45:9] Kings’ daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right
[Book of Psalms 45:10] Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget
[Book of Psalms 45:11] So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord;
[Book of Psalms 45:12] And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the
[Book of Psalms 45:13] The king’s daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of
[Book of Psalms 45:14] She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the
[Book of Psalms 45:15] With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall
[Book of Psalms 45:16] Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest
[Book of Psalms 45:17] I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:
[Book of Psalms 46:1] God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
[Book of Psalms 46:2] Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
[Book of Psalms 46:3] Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the
[Book of Psalms 46:4] There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of
[Book of Psalms 46:5] God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall
[Book of Psalms 46:6] The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice,
[Book of Psalms 46:7] The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
[Book of Psalms 46:8] Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made
[Book of Psalms 46:9] He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh
[Book of Psalms 46:10] Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the
[Book of Psalms 46:11] The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
[Book of Psalms 47:1] O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice
[Book of Psalms 47:2] For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all
[Book of Psalms 47:3] He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our
[Book of Psalms 47:4] He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob
[Book of Psalms 47:5] God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a
[Book of Psalms 47:6] Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King,
[Book of Psalms 47:7] For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with
[Book of Psalms 47:8] God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his
[Book of Psalms 47:9] The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people
[Book of Psalms 48:1] Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our
[Book of Psalms 48:2] Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount
[Book of Psalms 48:3] God is known in her palaces for a refuge.
[Book of Psalms 48:4] For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.
[Book of Psalms 48:5] They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and
[Book of Psalms 48:6] Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in
[Book of Psalms 48:7] Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.
[Book of Psalms 48:8] As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of
[Book of Psalms 48:9] We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy
[Book of Psalms 48:10] According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of
[Book of Psalms 48:11] Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad,
[Book of Psalms 48:12] Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers
[Book of Psalms 48:13] Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may
[Book of Psalms 48:14] For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide
[Book of Psalms 49:1] Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
[Book of Psalms 49:2] Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
[Book of Psalms 49:3] My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart
[Book of Psalms 49:4] I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying
[Book of Psalms 49:5] Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of
[Book of Psalms 49:6] They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the
[Book of Psalms 49:7] None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God
[Book of Psalms 49:8] (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for
[Book of Psalms 49:9] That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.
[Book of Psalms 49:10] For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the
[Book of Psalms 49:11] Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for
[Book of Psalms 49:12] Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the
[Book of Psalms 49:13] This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their
[Book of Psalms 49:14] Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them;
[Book of Psalms 49:15] But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he
[Book of Psalms 49:16] Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his
[Book of Psalms 49:17] For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall
[Book of Psalms 49:18] Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise
[Book of Psalms 49:19] He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never
[Book of Psalms 49:20] Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts
[Book of Psalms 50:1] The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth
[Book of Psalms 50:2] Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.
[Book of Psalms 50:3] Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall
[Book of Psalms 50:4] He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that
[Book of Psalms 50:5] Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a
[Book of Psalms 50:6] And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge
[Book of Psalms 50:7] Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify
[Book of Psalms 50:8] I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt
[Book of Psalms 50:9] I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy
[Book of Psalms 50:10] For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a
[Book of Psalms 50:11] I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of
[Book of Psalms 50:12] If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine,
[Book of Psalms 50:13] Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
[Book of Psalms 50:14] Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most
[Book of Psalms 50:15] And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and
[Book of Psalms 50:16] But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare
[Book of Psalms 50:17] Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind
[Book of Psalms 50:18] When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and
[Book of Psalms 50:19] Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.
[Book of Psalms 50:20] Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest
[Book of Psalms 50:21] These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest
[Book of Psalms 50:22] Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in
[Book of Psalms 50:23] Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth
[Book of Psalms 51:1] Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
[Book of Psalms 51:2] Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
[Book of Psalms 51:3] For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before
[Book of Psalms 51:4] Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
[Book of Psalms 51:5] Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
[Book of Psalms 51:6] Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the
[Book of Psalms 51:7] Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall
[Book of Psalms 51:8] Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast
[Book of Psalms 51:9] Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
[Book of Psalms 51:10] Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
[Book of Psalms 51:11] Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit
[Book of Psalms 51:12] Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy
[Book of Psalms 51:13] Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be
[Book of Psalms 51:14] Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my
[Book of Psalms 51:15] O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy
[Book of Psalms 51:16] For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou
[Book of Psalms 51:17] The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
[Book of Psalms 51:18] Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of
[Book of Psalms 51:19] Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,
[Book of Psalms 52:1] Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness
[Book of Psalms 52:2] The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working
[Book of Psalms 52:3] Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak
[Book of Psalms 52:4] Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.
[Book of Psalms 52:5] God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee
[Book of Psalms 52:6] The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:
[Book of Psalms 52:7] Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted
[Book of Psalms 52:8] But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in
[Book of Psalms 52:9] I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I
[Book of Psalms 53:1] The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are
[Book of Psalms 53:2] God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if
[Book of Psalms 53:3] Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become
[Book of Psalms 53:4] Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people
[Book of Psalms 53:5] There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath
[Book of Psalms 53:6] Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God
[Book of Psalms 54:1] Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
[Book of Psalms 54:2] Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
[Book of Psalms 54:3] For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after
[Book of Psalms 54:4] Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my
[Book of Psalms 54:5] He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy
[Book of Psalms 54:6] I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O
[Book of Psalms 54:7] For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath
[Book of Psalms 55:1] Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my
[Book of Psalms 55:2] Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a
[Book of Psalms 55:3] Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of
[Book of Psalms 55:4] My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are
[Book of Psalms 55:5] Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
[Book of Psalms 55:6] And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly
[Book of Psalms 55:7] Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.
[Book of Psalms 55:8] I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.
[Book of Psalms 55:9] Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen
[Book of Psalms 55:10] Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief
[Book of Psalms 55:11] Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not
[Book of Psalms 55:12] For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have
[Book of Psalms 55:13] But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
[Book of Psalms 55:14] We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God
[Book of Psalms 55:15] Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell:
[Book of Psalms 55:16] As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.
[Book of Psalms 55:17] Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:
[Book of Psalms 55:18] He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was
[Book of Psalms 55:19] God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.
[Book of Psalms 55:20] He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with
[Book of Psalms 55:21] The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in
[Book of Psalms 55:22] Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he
[Book of Psalms 55:23] But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of
[Book of Psalms 56:1] Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he
[Book of Psalms 56:2] Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that
[Book of Psalms 56:3] What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
[Book of Psalms 56:4] In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will
[Book of Psalms 56:5] Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me
[Book of Psalms 56:6] They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark
[Book of Psalms 56:7] Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the
[Book of Psalms 56:8] Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle:
[Book of Psalms 56:9] When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I
[Book of Psalms 56:10] In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his
[Book of Psalms 56:11] In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do
[Book of Psalms 56:12] Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.
[Book of Psalms 56:13] For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou
[Book of Psalms 57:1] Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul
[Book of Psalms 57:2] I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all
[Book of Psalms 57:3] He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him
[Book of Psalms 57:4] My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on
[Book of Psalms 57:5] Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above
[Book of Psalms 57:6] They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down:
[Book of Psalms 57:7] My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give
[Book of Psalms 57:8] Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake
[Book of Psalms 57:9] I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto
[Book of Psalms 57:10] For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the
[Book of Psalms 57:11] Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be
[Book of Psalms 58:1] Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge
[Book of Psalms 58:2] Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your
[Book of Psalms 58:3] The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as
[Book of Psalms 58:4] Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the
[Book of Psalms 58:5] Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never
[Book of Psalms 58:6] Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great
[Book of Psalms 58:7] Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he
[Book of Psalms 58:8] As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like
[Book of Psalms 58:9] Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as
[Book of Psalms 58:10] The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he
[Book of Psalms 58:11] So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the
[Book of Psalms 59:1] Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that
[Book of Psalms 59:2] Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody
[Book of Psalms 59:3] For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered
[Book of Psalms 59:4] They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help
[Book of Psalms 59:5] Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to
[Book of Psalms 59:6] They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go
[Book of Psalms 59:7] Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their
[Book of Psalms 59:8] But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the
[Book of Psalms 59:9] Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my
[Book of Psalms 59:10] The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my
[Book of Psalms 59:11] Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power;
[Book of Psalms 59:12] For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them
[Book of Psalms 59:13] Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and
[Book of Psalms 59:14] And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a
[Book of Psalms 59:15] Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not
[Book of Psalms 59:16] But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy
[Book of Psalms 59:17] Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence,
[Book of Psalms 60:1] O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast
[Book of Psalms 60:2] Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal
[Book of Psalms 60:3] Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to
[Book of Psalms 60:4] Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be
[Book of Psalms 60:5] That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and
[Book of Psalms 60:6] God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
[Book of Psalms 60:7] Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the
[Book of Psalms 60:8] Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia,
[Book of Psalms 60:9] Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
[Book of Psalms 60:10] Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God,
[Book of Psalms 60:11] Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
[Book of Psalms 60:12] Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread
[Book of Psalms 61:1] Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
[Book of Psalms 61:2] From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is
[Book of Psalms 61:3] For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the
[Book of Psalms 61:4] I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the
[Book of Psalms 61:5] For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the
[Book of Psalms 61:6] Thou wilt prolong the king’s life: and his years as many
[Book of Psalms 61:7] He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth,
[Book of Psalms 61:8] So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily
[Book of Psalms 62:1] Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.
[Book of Psalms 62:2] He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall
[Book of Psalms 62:3] How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be
[Book of Psalms 62:4] They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they
[Book of Psalms 62:5] My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.
[Book of Psalms 62:6] He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall
[Book of Psalms 62:7] In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and
[Book of Psalms 62:8] Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before
[Book of Psalms 62:9] Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a
[Book of Psalms 62:10] Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if
[Book of Psalms 62:11] God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power
[Book of Psalms 62:12] Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to
[Book of Psalms 63:1] O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth
[Book of Psalms 63:2] To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the
[Book of Psalms 63:3] Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall
[Book of Psalms 63:4] Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in
[Book of Psalms 63:5] My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my
[Book of Psalms 63:6] When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the
[Book of Psalms 63:7] Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy
[Book of Psalms 63:8] My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.
[Book of Psalms 63:9] But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the
[Book of Psalms 63:10] They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.
[Book of Psalms 63:11] But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by
[Book of Psalms 64:1] Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of
[Book of Psalms 64:2] Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the
[Book of Psalms 64:3] Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot
[Book of Psalms 64:4] That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they
[Book of Psalms 64:5] They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of
[Book of Psalms 64:6] They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search:
[Book of Psalms 64:7] But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be
[Book of Psalms 64:8] So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all
[Book of Psalms 64:9] And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for
[Book of Psalms 64:10] The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him;
[Book of Psalms 65:1] Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the
[Book of Psalms 65:2] O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
[Book of Psalms 65:3] Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou
[Book of Psalms 65:4] Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach
[Book of Psalms 65:5] By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of
[Book of Psalms 65:6] Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded
[Book of Psalms 65:7] Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves,
[Book of Psalms 65:8] They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy
[Book of Psalms 65:9] Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest
[Book of Psalms 65:10] Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the
[Book of Psalms 65:11] Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop
[Book of Psalms 65:12] They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little
[Book of Psalms 65:13] The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are
[Book of Psalms 66:1] Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:
[Book of Psalms 66:2] Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.
[Book of Psalms 66:3] Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the
[Book of Psalms 66:4] All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they
[Book of Psalms 66:5] Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward
[Book of Psalms 66:6] He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on
[Book of Psalms 66:7] He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let
[Book of Psalms 66:8] O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to
[Book of Psalms 66:9] Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be
[Book of Psalms 66:10] For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver
[Book of Psalms 66:11] Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our
[Book of Psalms 66:12] Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through
[Book of Psalms 66:13] I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee
[Book of Psalms 66:14] Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was
[Book of Psalms 66:15] I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the
[Book of Psalms 66:16] Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he
[Book of Psalms 66:17] I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my
[Book of Psalms 66:18] If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:
[Book of Psalms 66:19] But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of
[Book of Psalms 66:20] Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his
[Book of Psalms 67:1] God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to
[Book of Psalms 67:2] That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all
[Book of Psalms 67:3] Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
[Book of Psalms 67:4] O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge
[Book of Psalms 67:5] Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
[Book of Psalms 67:6] Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own
[Book of Psalms 67:7] God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
[Book of Psalms 68:1] Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that
[Book of Psalms 68:2] As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth
[Book of Psalms 68:3] But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea,
[Book of Psalms 68:4] Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth
[Book of Psalms 68:5] A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in
[Book of Psalms 68:6] God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which
[Book of Psalms 68:7] O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst
[Book of Psalms 68:8] The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God:
[Book of Psalms 68:9] Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst
[Book of Psalms 68:10] Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared
[Book of Psalms 68:11] The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that
[Book of Psalms 68:12] Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home
[Book of Psalms 68:13] Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings
[Book of Psalms 68:14] When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in
[Book of Psalms 68:15] The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the
[Book of Psalms 68:16] Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth
[Book of Psalms 68:17] The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of
[Book of Psalms 68:18] Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive:
[Book of Psalms 68:19] Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even
[Book of Psalms 68:20] He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the
[Book of Psalms 68:21] But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp
[Book of Psalms 68:22] The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my
[Book of Psalms 68:23] That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and
[Book of Psalms 68:24] They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my
[Book of Psalms 68:25] The singers went before, the players on instruments followed
[Book of Psalms 68:26] Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the
[Book of Psalms 68:27] There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah
[Book of Psalms 68:28] Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that
[Book of Psalms 68:29] Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents
[Book of Psalms 68:30] Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with
[Book of Psalms 68:31] Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out
[Book of Psalms 68:32] Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the
[Book of Psalms 68:33] To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of
[Book of Psalms 68:34] Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and
[Book of Psalms 68:35] O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of
[Book of Psalms 69:1] Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.
[Book of Psalms 69:2] I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into
[Book of Psalms 69:3] I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while
[Book of Psalms 69:4] They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine
[Book of Psalms 69:5] O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from
[Book of Psalms 69:6] Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed
[Book of Psalms 69:7] Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my
[Book of Psalms 69:8] I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my
[Book of Psalms 69:9] For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches
[Book of Psalms 69:10] When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my
[Book of Psalms 69:11] I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to
[Book of Psalms 69:12] They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song
[Book of Psalms 69:13] But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable
[Book of Psalms 69:14] Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be
[Book of Psalms 69:15] Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow
[Book of Psalms 69:16] Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me
[Book of Psalms 69:17] And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:
[Book of Psalms 69:18] Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of
[Book of Psalms 69:19] Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:
[Book of Psalms 69:20] Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I
[Book of Psalms 69:21] They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave
[Book of Psalms 69:22] Let their table become a snare before them: and that which
[Book of Psalms 69:23] Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their
[Book of Psalms 69:24] Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger
[Book of Psalms 69:25] Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their
[Book of Psalms 69:26] For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to
[Book of Psalms 69:27] Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy
[Book of Psalms 69:28] Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be
[Book of Psalms 69:29] But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up
[Book of Psalms 69:30] I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him
[Book of Psalms 69:31] This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock
[Book of Psalms 69:32] The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall
[Book of Psalms 69:33] For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.
[Book of Psalms 69:34] Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing
[Book of Psalms 69:35] For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that
[Book of Psalms 69:36] The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that
[Book of Psalms 70:1] Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O Lord.
[Book of Psalms 70:2] Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let
[Book of Psalms 70:3] Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say,
[Book of Psalms 70:4] Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let
[Book of Psalms 70:5] But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my
[Book of Psalms 71:1] In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to
[Book of Psalms 71:2] Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline
[Book of Psalms 71:3] Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort:
[Book of Psalms 71:4] Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the
[Book of Psalms 71:5] For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my
[Book of Psalms 71:6] By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that
[Book of Psalms 71:7] I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.
[Book of Psalms 71:8] Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all
[Book of Psalms 71:9] Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my
[Book of Psalms 71:10] For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my
[Book of Psalms 71:11] Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there
[Book of Psalms 71:12] O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.
[Book of Psalms 71:13] Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my
[Book of Psalms 71:14] But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and
[Book of Psalms 71:15] My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation
[Book of Psalms 71:16] I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention
[Book of Psalms 71:17] O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I
[Book of Psalms 71:18] Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not;
[Book of Psalms 71:19] Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great
[Book of Psalms 71:20] Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt
[Book of Psalms 71:21] Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.
[Book of Psalms 71:22] I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my
[Book of Psalms 71:23] My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my
[Book of Psalms 71:24] My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long:
[Book of Psalms 72:1] Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto
[Book of Psalms 72:2] He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with
[Book of Psalms 72:3] The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little
[Book of Psalms 72:4] He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children
[Book of Psalms 72:5] They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,
[Book of Psalms 72:6] He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that
[Book of Psalms 72:7] In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace
[Book of Psalms 72:8] He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river
[Book of Psalms 72:9] They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his
[Book of Psalms 72:10] The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the
[Book of Psalms 72:11] Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall
[Book of Psalms 72:12] For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also,
[Book of Psalms 72:13] He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of
[Book of Psalms 72:14] He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and
[Book of Psalms 72:15] And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of
[Book of Psalms 72:16] There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of
[Book of Psalms 72:17] His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as
[Book of Psalms 72:18] Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth
[Book of Psalms 72:19] And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole
[Book of Psalms 72:20] The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
[Book of Psalms 73:1] Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean
[Book of Psalms 73:2] But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh
[Book of Psalms 73:3] For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of
[Book of Psalms 73:4] For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is
[Book of Psalms 73:5] They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued
[Book of Psalms 73:6] Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence
[Book of Psalms 73:7] Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart
[Book of Psalms 73:8] They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they
[Book of Psalms 73:9] They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue
[Book of Psalms 73:10] Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are
[Book of Psalms 73:11] And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the
[Book of Psalms 73:12] Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they
[Book of Psalms 73:13] Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in
[Book of Psalms 73:14] For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every
[Book of Psalms 73:15] If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the
[Book of Psalms 73:16] When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;
[Book of Psalms 73:17] Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their
[Book of Psalms 73:18] Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst
[Book of Psalms 73:19] How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are
[Book of Psalms 73:20] As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou
[Book of Psalms 73:21] Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
[Book of Psalms 73:22] So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.
[Book of Psalms 73:23] Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by
[Book of Psalms 73:24] Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me
[Book of Psalms 73:25] Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth
[Book of Psalms 73:26] My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my
[Book of Psalms 73:27] For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast
[Book of Psalms 73:28] But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust
[Book of Psalms 74:1] O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger
[Book of Psalms 74:2] Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the
[Book of Psalms 74:3] Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that
[Book of Psalms 74:4] Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up
[Book of Psalms 74:5] A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the
[Book of Psalms 74:6] But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes
[Book of Psalms 74:7] They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by
[Book of Psalms 74:8] They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they
[Book of Psalms 74:9] We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is
[Book of Psalms 74:10] O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy
[Book of Psalms 74:11] Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out
[Book of Psalms 74:12] For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the
[Book of Psalms 74:13] Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the
[Book of Psalms 74:14] Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to
[Book of Psalms 74:15] Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up
[Book of Psalms 74:16] The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared
[Book of Psalms 74:17] Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made
[Book of Psalms 74:18] Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that
[Book of Psalms 74:19] O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of
[Book of Psalms 74:20] Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth
[Book of Psalms 74:21] O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy
[Book of Psalms 74:22] Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish
[Book of Psalms 74:23] Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that
[Book of Psalms 75:1] Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks:
[Book of Psalms 75:2] When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.
[Book of Psalms 75:3] The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear
[Book of Psalms 75:4] I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked,
[Book of Psalms 75:5] Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.
[Book of Psalms 75:6] For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,
[Book of Psalms 75:7] But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up
[Book of Psalms 75:8] For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red;
[Book of Psalms 75:9] But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of
[Book of Psalms 75:10] All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns
[Book of Psalms 76:1] In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.
[Book of Psalms 76:2] In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.
[Book of Psalms 76:3] There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword,
[Book of Psalms 76:4] Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.
[Book of Psalms 76:5] The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and
[Book of Psalms 76:6] At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are
[Book of Psalms 76:7] Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight
[Book of Psalms 76:8] Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth
[Book of Psalms 76:9] When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
[Book of Psalms 76:10] Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of
[Book of Psalms 76:11] Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about
[Book of Psalms 76:12] He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the
[Book of Psalms 77:1] I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and
[Book of Psalms 77:2] In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the
[Book of Psalms 77:3] I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit
[Book of Psalms 77:4] Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot
[Book of Psalms 77:5] I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
[Book of Psalms 77:6] I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine
[Book of Psalms 77:7] Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no
[Book of Psalms 77:8] Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for
[Book of Psalms 77:9] Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his
[Book of Psalms 77:10] And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years
[Book of Psalms 77:11] I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember
[Book of Psalms 77:12] I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
[Book of Psalms 77:13] Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as
[Book of Psalms 77:14] Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy
[Book of Psalms 77:15] Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob
[Book of Psalms 77:16] The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were
[Book of Psalms 77:17] The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine
[Book of Psalms 77:18] The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings
[Book of Psalms 77:19] Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy
[Book of Psalms 77:20] Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and
[Book of Psalms 78:1] Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words
[Book of Psalms 78:2] I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of
[Book of Psalms 78:3] Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
[Book of Psalms 78:4] We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the
[Book of Psalms 78:5] For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in
[Book of Psalms 78:6] That the generation to come might know them, even the children
[Book of Psalms 78:7] That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works
[Book of Psalms 78:8] And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
[Book of Psalms 78:9] The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned
[Book of Psalms 78:10] They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his
[Book of Psalms 78:11] And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
[Book of Psalms 78:12] Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the
[Book of Psalms 78:13] He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made
[Book of Psalms 78:14] In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night
[Book of Psalms 78:15] He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out
[Book of Psalms 78:16] He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to
[Book of Psalms 78:17] And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High
[Book of Psalms 78:18] And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their
[Book of Psalms 78:19] Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table
[Book of Psalms 78:20] Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the
[Book of Psalms 78:21] Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was
[Book of Psalms 78:22] Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
[Book of Psalms 78:23] Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the
[Book of Psalms 78:24] And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them
[Book of Psalms 78:25] Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.
[Book of Psalms 78:26] He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power
[Book of Psalms 78:27] He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like
[Book of Psalms 78:28] And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their
[Book of Psalms 78:29] So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their
[Book of Psalms 78:30] They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat
[Book of Psalms 78:31] The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,
[Book of Psalms 78:32] For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his
[Book of Psalms 78:33] Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years
[Book of Psalms 78:34] When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and
[Book of Psalms 78:35] And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God
[Book of Psalms 78:36] Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they
[Book of Psalms 78:37] For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
[Book of Psalms 78:38] But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and
[Book of Psalms 78:39] For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth
[Book of Psalms 78:40] How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him
[Book of Psalms 78:41] Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One
[Book of Psalms 78:42] They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them
[Book of Psalms 78:43] How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the
[Book of Psalms 78:44] And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that
[Book of Psalms 78:45] He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;
[Book of Psalms 78:46] He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their
[Book of Psalms 78:47] He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees
[Book of Psalms 78:48] He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to
[Book of Psalms 78:49] He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
[Book of Psalms 78:50] He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death,
[Book of Psalms 78:51] And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their
[Book of Psalms 78:52] But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them
[Book of Psalms 78:53] And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea
[Book of Psalms 78:54] And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this
[Book of Psalms 78:55] He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
[Book of Psalms 78:56] Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not
[Book of Psalms 78:57] But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they
[Book of Psalms 78:58] For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved
[Book of Psalms 78:59] When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
[Book of Psalms 78:60] So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he
[Book of Psalms 78:61] And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into
[Book of Psalms 78:62] He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with
[Book of Psalms 78:63] The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not
[Book of Psalms 78:64] Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
[Book of Psalms 78:65] Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man
[Book of Psalms 78:66] And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a
[Book of Psalms 78:67] Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the
[Book of Psalms 78:68] But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
[Book of Psalms 78:69] And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth
[Book of Psalms 78:70] He chose David also his servant, and took him from the
[Book of Psalms 78:71] From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed
[Book of Psalms 78:72] So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and
[Book of Psalms 79:1] O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy
[Book of Psalms 79:2] The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto
[Book of Psalms 79:3] Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and
[Book of Psalms 79:4] We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision
[Book of Psalms 79:5] How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy
[Book of Psalms 79:6] Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and
[Book of Psalms 79:7] For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
[Book of Psalms 79:8] O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender
[Book of Psalms 79:9] Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and
[Book of Psalms 79:10] Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be
[Book of Psalms 79:11] Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to
[Book of Psalms 79:12] And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their
[Book of Psalms 79:13] So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks
[Book of Psalms 80:1] Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a
[Book of Psalms 80:2] Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,
[Book of Psalms 80:3] Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall
[Book of Psalms 80:4] O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the
[Book of Psalms 80:5] Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears
[Book of Psalms 80:6] Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies
[Book of Psalms 80:7] Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and
[Book of Psalms 80:8] Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the
[Book of Psalms 80:9] Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep
[Book of Psalms 80:10] The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs
[Book of Psalms 80:11] She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the
[Book of Psalms 80:12] Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they
[Book of Psalms 80:13] The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of
[Book of Psalms 80:14] Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven,
[Book of Psalms 80:15] And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the
[Book of Psalms 80:16] It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the
[Book of Psalms 80:17] Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of
[Book of Psalms 80:18] So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call
[Book of Psalms 80:19] Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and
[Book of Psalms 81:1] Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the
[Book of Psalms 81:2] Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp
[Book of Psalms 81:3] Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on
[Book of Psalms 81:4] For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.
[Book of Psalms 81:5] This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out
[Book of Psalms 81:6] I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered
[Book of Psalms 81:7] Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee
[Book of Psalms 81:8] Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if
[Book of Psalms 81:9] There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship
[Book of Psalms 81:10] I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
[Book of Psalms 81:11] But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would
[Book of Psalms 81:12] So I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lust: and they walked
[Book of Psalms 81:13] Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked
[Book of Psalms 81:14] I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand
[Book of Psalms 81:15] The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto
[Book of Psalms 81:16] He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and
[Book of Psalms 82:1] God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among
[Book of Psalms 82:2] How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the
[Book of Psalms 82:3] Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and
[Book of Psalms 82:4] Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the
[Book of Psalms 82:5] They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in
[Book of Psalms 82:6] I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most
[Book of Psalms 82:7] But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
[Book of Psalms 82:8] Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all
[Book of Psalms 83:1] Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not
[Book of Psalms 83:2] For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee
[Book of Psalms 83:3] They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted
[Book of Psalms 83:4] They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a
[Book of Psalms 83:5] For they have consulted together with one consent: they are
[Book of Psalms 83:6] The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the
[Book of Psalms 83:7] Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the
[Book of Psalms 83:8] Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of
[Book of Psalms 83:9] Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin,
[Book of Psalms 83:10] Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.
[Book of Psalms 83:11] Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their
[Book of Psalms 83:12] Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in
[Book of Psalms 83:13] O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the
[Book of Psalms 83:14] As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the
[Book of Psalms 83:15] So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with
[Book of Psalms 83:16] Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O
[Book of Psalms 83:17] Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be
[Book of Psalms 83:18] That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art
[Book of Psalms 84:1] How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!
[Book of Psalms 84:2] My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD:
[Book of Psalms 84:3] Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for
[Book of Psalms 84:4] Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still
[Book of Psalms 84:5] Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are
[Book of Psalms 84:6] Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain
[Book of Psalms 84:7] They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion
[Book of Psalms 84:8] O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.
[Book of Psalms 84:9] Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine
[Book of Psalms 84:10] For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather
[Book of Psalms 84:11] For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace
[Book of Psalms 84:12] O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
[Book of Psalms 85:1] Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought
[Book of Psalms 85:2] Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered
[Book of Psalms 85:3] Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from
[Book of Psalms 85:4] Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us
[Book of Psalms 85:5] Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine
[Book of Psalms 85:6] Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in
[Book of Psalms 85:7] Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.
[Book of Psalms 85:8] I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace
[Book of Psalms 85:9] Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may
[Book of Psalms 85:10] Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
[Book of Psalms 85:11] Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall
[Book of Psalms 85:12] Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall
[Book of Psalms 85:13] Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way
[Book of Psalms 86:1] Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.
[Book of Psalms 86:2] Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant
[Book of Psalms 86:3] Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.
[Book of Psalms 86:4] Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift
[Book of Psalms 86:5] For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in
[Book of Psalms 86:6] Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my
[Book of Psalms 86:7] In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt
[Book of Psalms 86:8] Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are
[Book of Psalms 86:9] All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before
[Book of Psalms 86:10] For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God
[Book of Psalms 86:11] Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my
[Book of Psalms 86:12] I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will
[Book of Psalms 86:13] For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my
[Book of Psalms 86:14] O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of
[Book of Psalms 86:15] But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,
[Book of Psalms 86:16] O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto
[Book of Psalms 86:17] Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it,
[Book of Psalms 87:1] His foundation is in the holy mountains.
[Book of Psalms 87:2] The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of
[Book of Psalms 87:3] Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.
[Book of Psalms 87:4] I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me:
[Book of Psalms 87:5] And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her:
[Book of Psalms 87:6] The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this
[Book of Psalms 87:7] As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there:
[Book of Psalms 88:1] O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
[Book of Psalms 88:2] Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;
[Book of Psalms 88:3] For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto
[Book of Psalms 88:4] I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man
[Book of Psalms 88:5] Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom
[Book of Psalms 88:6] Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
[Book of Psalms 88:7] Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all
[Book of Psalms 88:8] Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made
[Book of Psalms 88:9] Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called
[Book of Psalms 88:10] Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and
[Book of Psalms 88:11] Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy
[Book of Psalms 88:12] Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in
[Book of Psalms 88:13] But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my
[Book of Psalms 88:14] LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face
[Book of Psalms 88:15] I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer
[Book of Psalms 88:16] Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
[Book of Psalms 88:17] They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me
[Book of Psalms 88:18] Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine
[Book of Psalms 89:1] I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth
[Book of Psalms 89:2] For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy
[Book of Psalms 89:3] I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my
[Book of Psalms 89:4] Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to
[Book of Psalms 89:5] And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy
[Book of Psalms 89:6] For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among
[Book of Psalms 89:7] God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to
[Book of Psalms 89:8] O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to
[Book of Psalms 89:9] Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise,
[Book of Psalms 89:10] Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou
[Book of Psalms 89:11] The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world
[Book of Psalms 89:12] The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon
[Book of Psalms 89:13] Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy
[Book of Psalms 89:14] Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and
[Book of Psalms 89:15] Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall
[Book of Psalms 89:16] In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy
[Book of Psalms 89:17] For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our
[Book of Psalms 89:18] For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our
[Book of Psalms 89:19] Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have
[Book of Psalms 89:20] I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed
[Book of Psalms 89:21] With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall
[Book of Psalms 89:22] The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness
[Book of Psalms 89:23] And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them
[Book of Psalms 89:24] But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my
[Book of Psalms 89:25] I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the
[Book of Psalms 89:26] He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock
[Book of Psalms 89:27] Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the
[Book of Psalms 89:28] My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall
[Book of Psalms 89:29] His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as
[Book of Psalms 89:30] If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
[Book of Psalms 89:31] If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
[Book of Psalms 89:32] Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their
[Book of Psalms 89:33] Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him,
[Book of Psalms 89:34] My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone
[Book of Psalms 89:35] Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
[Book of Psalms 89:36] His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before
[Book of Psalms 89:37] It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful
[Book of Psalms 89:38] But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with
[Book of Psalms 89:39] Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast
[Book of Psalms 89:40] Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his
[Book of Psalms 89:41] All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his
[Book of Psalms 89:42] Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast
[Book of Psalms 89:43] Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made
[Book of Psalms 89:44] Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to
[Book of Psalms 89:45] The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him
[Book of Psalms 89:46] How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath
[Book of Psalms 89:47] Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men
[Book of Psalms 89:48] What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he
[Book of Psalms 89:49] Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest
[Book of Psalms 89:50] Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in
[Book of Psalms 89:51] Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they
[Book of Psalms 89:52] Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
[Book of Psalms 90:1] Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
[Book of Psalms 90:2] Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
[Book of Psalms 90:3] Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children
[Book of Psalms 90:4] For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is
[Book of Psalms 90:5] Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in
[Book of Psalms 90:6] In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it
[Book of Psalms 90:7] For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we
[Book of Psalms 90:8] Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the
[Book of Psalms 90:9] For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years
[Book of Psalms 90:10] The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by
[Book of Psalms 90:11] Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy
[Book of Psalms 90:12] So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts
[Book of Psalms 90:13] Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy
[Book of Psalms 90:14] O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be
[Book of Psalms 90:15] Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted
[Book of Psalms 90:16] Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their
[Book of Psalms 90:17] And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish
[Book of Psalms 91:1] He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide
[Book of Psalms 91:2] I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God;
[Book of Psalms 91:3] Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and
[Book of Psalms 91:4] He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt
[Book of Psalms 91:5] Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the
[Book of Psalms 91:6] Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
[Book of Psalms 91:7] A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right
[Book of Psalms 91:8] Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the
[Book of Psalms 91:9] Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the
[Book of Psalms 91:10] There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come
[Book of Psalms 91:11] For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in
[Book of Psalms 91:12] They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot
[Book of Psalms 91:13] Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the
[Book of Psalms 91:14] Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver
[Book of Psalms 91:15] He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him
[Book of Psalms 91:16] With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
[Book of Psalms 92:1] It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing
[Book of Psalms 92:2] To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy
[Book of Psalms 92:3] Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon
[Book of Psalms 92:4] For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will
[Book of Psalms 92:5] O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.
[Book of Psalms 92:6] A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.
[Book of Psalms 92:7] When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of
[Book of Psalms 92:8] But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.
[Book of Psalms 92:9] For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall
[Book of Psalms 92:10] But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I
[Book of Psalms 92:11] Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears
[Book of Psalms 92:12] The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow
[Book of Psalms 92:13] Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in
[Book of Psalms 92:14] They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat
[Book of Psalms 92:15] To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no
[Book of Psalms 93:1] The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is
[Book of Psalms 93:2] Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.
[Book of Psalms 93:3] The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up
[Book of Psalms 93:4] The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea,
[Book of Psalms 93:5] Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O
[Book of Psalms 94:1] O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance
[Book of Psalms 94:2] Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the
[Book of Psalms 94:3] LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked
[Book of Psalms 94:4] How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the
[Book of Psalms 94:5] They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine
[Book of Psalms 94:6] They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.
[Book of Psalms 94:7] Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of
[Book of Psalms 94:8] Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will
[Book of Psalms 94:9] He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the
[Book of Psalms 94:10] He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that
[Book of Psalms 94:11] The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.
[Book of Psalms 94:12] Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest
[Book of Psalms 94:13] That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until
[Book of Psalms 94:14] For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he
[Book of Psalms 94:15] But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the
[Book of Psalms 94:16] Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand
[Book of Psalms 94:17] Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in
[Book of Psalms 94:18] When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.
[Book of Psalms 94:19] In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight
[Book of Psalms 94:20] Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which
[Book of Psalms 94:21] They gather themselves together against the soul of the
[Book of Psalms 94:22] But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.
[Book of Psalms 94:23] And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut
[Book of Psalms 95:1] O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to
[Book of Psalms 95:2] Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a
[Book of Psalms 95:3] For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
[Book of Psalms 95:4] In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the
[Book of Psalms 95:5] The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry
[Book of Psalms 95:6] O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD
[Book of Psalms 95:7] For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the
[Book of Psalms 95:8] Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day
[Book of Psalms 95:9] When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.
[Book of Psalms 95:10] Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,
[Book of Psalms 95:11] Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my
[Book of Psalms 96:1] O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the
[Book of Psalms 96:2] Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from
[Book of Psalms 96:3] Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all
[Book of Psalms 96:4] For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be
[Book of Psalms 96:5] For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the
[Book of Psalms 96:6] Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his
[Book of Psalms 96:7] Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
[Book of Psalms 96:8] Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
[Book of Psalms 96:9] O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him,
[Book of Psalms 96:10] Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also
[Book of Psalms 96:11] Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea
[Book of Psalms 96:12] Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all
[Book of Psalms 96:13] Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the
[Book of Psalms 97:1] The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of
[Book of Psalms 97:2] Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and
[Book of Psalms 97:3] A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.
[Book of Psalms 97:4] His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and
[Book of Psalms 97:5] The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the
[Book of Psalms 97:6] The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his
[Book of Psalms 97:7] Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast
[Book of Psalms 97:8] Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced
[Book of Psalms 97:9] For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted
[Book of Psalms 97:10] Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his
[Book of Psalms 97:11] Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in
[Book of Psalms 97:12] Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the
[Book of Psalms 98:1] O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous
[Book of Psalms 98:2] The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he
[Book of Psalms 98:3] He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of
[Book of Psalms 98:4] Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud
[Book of Psalms 98:5] Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of
[Book of Psalms 98:6] With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the
[Book of Psalms 98:7] Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they
[Book of Psalms 98:8] Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together
[Book of Psalms 98:9] Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with
[Book of Psalms 99:1] The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the
[Book of Psalms 99:2] The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.
[Book of Psalms 99:3] Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.
[Book of Psalms 99:4] The king’s strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish
[Book of Psalms 99:5] Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he
[Book of Psalms 99:6] Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that
[Book of Psalms 99:7] He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his
[Book of Psalms 99:8] Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that
[Book of Psalms 99:9] Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the
[Book of Psalms 100:1] Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.
[Book of Psalms 100:2] Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with
[Book of Psalms 100:3] Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and
[Book of Psalms 100:4] Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with
[Book of Psalms 100:5] For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth
[Book of Psalms 101:1] I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I
[Book of Psalms 101:2] I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou
[Book of Psalms 101:3] I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of
[Book of Psalms 101:4] A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked
[Book of Psalms 101:5] Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him
[Book of Psalms 101:6] Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may
[Book of Psalms 101:7] He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that
[Book of Psalms 101:8] I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut
[Book of Psalms 102:1] Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.
[Book of Psalms 102:2] Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;
[Book of Psalms 102:3] For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as
[Book of Psalms 102:4] My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget
[Book of Psalms 102:5] By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my
[Book of Psalms 102:6] I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the
[Book of Psalms 102:7] I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.
[Book of Psalms 102:8] Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad
[Book of Psalms 102:9] For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with
[Book of Psalms 102:10] Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast
[Book of Psalms 102:11] My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered
[Book of Psalms 102:12] But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance
[Book of Psalms 102:13] Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to
[Book of Psalms 102:14] For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the
[Book of Psalms 102:15] So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the
[Book of Psalms 102:16] When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his
[Book of Psalms 102:17] He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise
[Book of Psalms 102:18] This shall be written for the generation to come: and the
[Book of Psalms 102:19] For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from
[Book of Psalms 102:20] To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are
[Book of Psalms 102:21] To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in
[Book of Psalms 102:22] When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to
[Book of Psalms 102:23] He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.
[Book of Psalms 102:24] I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy
[Book of Psalms 102:25] Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the
[Book of Psalms 102:26] They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them
[Book of Psalms 102:27] But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.
[Book of Psalms 102:28] The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed
[Book of Psalms 103:1] Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his
[Book of Psalms 103:2] Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
[Book of Psalms 103:3] Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
[Book of Psalms 103:4] Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with
[Book of Psalms 103:5] Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is
[Book of Psalms 103:6] The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
[Book of Psalms 103:7] He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of
[Book of Psalms 103:8] The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous
[Book of Psalms 103:9] He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for
[Book of Psalms 103:10] He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
[Book of Psalms 103:11] For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his
[Book of Psalms 103:12] As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our
[Book of Psalms 103:13] Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them
[Book of Psalms 103:14] For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
[Book of Psalms 103:15] As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so
[Book of Psalms 103:16] For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place
[Book of Psalms 103:17] But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting
[Book of Psalms 103:18] To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his
[Book of Psalms 103:19] The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his
[Book of Psalms 103:20] Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do
[Book of Psalms 103:21] Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that
[Book of Psalms 103:22] Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion:
[Book of Psalms 104:1] Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great;
[Book of Psalms 104:2] Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who
[Book of Psalms 104:3] Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh
[Book of Psalms 104:4] Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
[Book of Psalms 104:5] Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be
[Book of Psalms 104:6] Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters
[Book of Psalms 104:7] At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted
[Book of Psalms 104:8] They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto
[Book of Psalms 104:9] Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they
[Book of Psalms 104:10] He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the
[Book of Psalms 104:11] They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses
[Book of Psalms 104:12] By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
[Book of Psalms 104:13] He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied
[Book of Psalms 104:14] He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the
[Book of Psalms 104:15] And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his
[Book of Psalms 104:16] The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,
[Book of Psalms 104:17] Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir
[Book of Psalms 104:18] The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks
[Book of Psalms 104:19] He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going
[Book of Psalms 104:20] Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts
[Book of Psalms 104:21] The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from
[Book of Psalms 104:22] The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them
[Book of Psalms 104:23] Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the
[Book of Psalms 104:24] O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made
[Book of Psalms 104:25] So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
[Book of Psalms 104:26] There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast
[Book of Psalms 104:27] These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat
[Book of Psalms 104:28] That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand,
[Book of Psalms 104:29] Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their
[Book of Psalms 104:30] Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou
[Book of Psalms 104:31] The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall
[Book of Psalms 104:32] He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the
[Book of Psalms 104:33] I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise
[Book of Psalms 104:34] My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the
[Book of Psalms 104:35] Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the
[Book of Psalms 105:1] O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his
[Book of Psalms 105:2] Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous
[Book of Psalms 105:3] Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
[Book of Psalms 105:4] Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.
[Book of Psalms 105:5] Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders,
[Book of Psalms 105:6] O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his
[Book of Psalms 105:7] He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.
[Book of Psalms 105:8] He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he
[Book of Psalms 105:9] Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
[Book of Psalms 105:10] And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for
[Book of Psalms 105:11] Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
[Book of Psalms 105:12] When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and
[Book of Psalms 105:13] When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to
[Book of Psalms 105:14] He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for
[Book of Psalms 105:15] Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
[Book of Psalms 105:16] Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the
[Book of Psalms 105:17] He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a
[Book of Psalms 105:18] Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
[Book of Psalms 105:19] Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried
[Book of Psalms 105:20] The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and
[Book of Psalms 105:21] He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
[Book of Psalms 105:22] To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators
[Book of Psalms 105:23] Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of
[Book of Psalms 105:24] And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger
[Book of Psalms 105:25] He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with
[Book of Psalms 105:26] He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.
[Book of Psalms 105:27] They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of
[Book of Psalms 105:28] He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not
[Book of Psalms 105:29] He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
[Book of Psalms 105:30] Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of
[Book of Psalms 105:31] He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all
[Book of Psalms 105:32] He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
[Book of Psalms 105:33] He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the
[Book of Psalms 105:34] He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that
[Book of Psalms 105:35] And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the
[Book of Psalms 105:36] He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all
[Book of Psalms 105:37] He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was
[Book of Psalms 105:38] Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell
[Book of Psalms 105:39] He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the
[Book of Psalms 105:40] The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them
[Book of Psalms 105:41] He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the
[Book of Psalms 105:42] For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.
[Book of Psalms 105:43] And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with
[Book of Psalms 105:44] And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the
[Book of Psalms 105:45] That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise
[Book of Psalms 106:1] Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:
[Book of Psalms 106:2] Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth
[Book of Psalms 106:3] Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth
[Book of Psalms 106:4] Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy
[Book of Psalms 106:5] That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the
[Book of Psalms 106:6] We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we
[Book of Psalms 106:7] Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered
[Book of Psalms 106:8] Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might
[Book of Psalms 106:9] He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them
[Book of Psalms 106:10] And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and
[Book of Psalms 106:11] And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them
[Book of Psalms 106:12] Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
[Book of Psalms 106:13] They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
[Book of Psalms 106:14] But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in
[Book of Psalms 106:15] And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their
[Book of Psalms 106:16] They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the
[Book of Psalms 106:17] The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the
[Book of Psalms 106:18] And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up
[Book of Psalms 106:19] They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
[Book of Psalms 106:20] Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that
[Book of Psalms 106:21] They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in
[Book of Psalms 106:22] Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the
[Book of Psalms 106:23] Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his
[Book of Psalms 106:24] Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his
[Book of Psalms 106:25] But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice
[Book of Psalms 106:26] Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them
[Book of Psalms 106:27] To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter
[Book of Psalms 106:28] They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the
[Book of Psalms 106:29] Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the
[Book of Psalms 106:30] Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the
[Book of Psalms 106:31] And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
[Book of Psalms 106:32] They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went
[Book of Psalms 106:33] Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly
[Book of Psalms 106:34] They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD
[Book of Psalms 106:35] But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
[Book of Psalms 106:36] And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
[Book of Psalms 106:37] Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
[Book of Psalms 106:38] And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
[Book of Psalms 106:39] Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring
[Book of Psalms 106:40] Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people,
[Book of Psalms 106:41] And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
[Book of Psalms 106:42] Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
[Book of Psalms 106:43] Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with
[Book of Psalms 106:44] Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their
[Book of Psalms 106:45] And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according
[Book of Psalms 106:46] He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
[Book of Psalms 106:47] Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen,
[Book of Psalms 106:48] Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to
[Book of Psalms 107:1] O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy
[Book of Psalms 107:2] Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from
[Book of Psalms 107:3] And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the
[Book of Psalms 107:4] They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no
[Book of Psalms 107:5] Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
[Book of Psalms 107:6] Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered
[Book of Psalms 107:7] And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a
[Book of Psalms 107:8] Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
[Book of Psalms 107:9] For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul
[Book of Psalms 107:10] Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound
[Book of Psalms 107:11] Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned
[Book of Psalms 107:12] Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell
[Book of Psalms 107:13] Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved
[Book of Psalms 107:14] He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and
[Book of Psalms 107:15] Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
[Book of Psalms 107:16] For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron
[Book of Psalms 107:17] Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
[Book of Psalms 107:18] Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near
[Book of Psalms 107:19] Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth
[Book of Psalms 107:20] He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from
[Book of Psalms 107:21] Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
[Book of Psalms 107:22] And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and
[Book of Psalms 107:23] They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in
[Book of Psalms 107:24] These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
[Book of Psalms 107:25] For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth
[Book of Psalms 107:26] They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:
[Book of Psalms 107:27] They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are
[Book of Psalms 107:28] Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth
[Book of Psalms 107:29] He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are
[Book of Psalms 107:30] Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them
[Book of Psalms 107:31] Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
[Book of Psalms 107:32] Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and
[Book of Psalms 107:33] He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into
[Book of Psalms 107:34] A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them
[Book of Psalms 107:35] He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground
[Book of Psalms 107:36] And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare
[Book of Psalms 107:37] And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits
[Book of Psalms 107:38] He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and
[Book of Psalms 107:39] Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
[Book of Psalms 107:40] He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in
[Book of Psalms 107:41] Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him
[Book of Psalms 107:42] The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall
[Book of Psalms 107:43] Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall
[Book of Psalms 108:1] O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with
[Book of Psalms 108:2] Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
[Book of Psalms 108:3] I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing
[Book of Psalms 108:4] For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth
[Book of Psalms 108:5] Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above
[Book of Psalms 108:6] That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and
[Book of Psalms 108:7] God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
[Book of Psalms 108:8] Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength
[Book of Psalms 108:9] Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over
[Book of Psalms 108:10] Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
[Book of Psalms 108:11] Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou,
[Book of Psalms 108:12] Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
[Book of Psalms 108:13] Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
[Book of Psalms 109:1] Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
[Book of Psalms 109:2] For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are
[Book of Psalms 109:3] They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought
[Book of Psalms 109:4] For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto
[Book of Psalms 109:5] And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
[Book of Psalms 109:6] Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right
[Book of Psalms 109:7] When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his
[Book of Psalms 109:8] Let his days be few; and let another take his office.
[Book of Psalms 109:9] Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
[Book of Psalms 109:10] Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them
[Book of Psalms 109:11] Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the
[Book of Psalms 109:12] Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there
[Book of Psalms 109:13] Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following
[Book of Psalms 109:14] Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;
[Book of Psalms 109:15] Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off
[Book of Psalms 109:16] Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted
[Book of Psalms 109:17] As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted
[Book of Psalms 109:18] As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so
[Book of Psalms 109:19] Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a
[Book of Psalms 109:20] Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and
[Book of Psalms 109:21] But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name’s sake:
[Book of Psalms 109:22] For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
[Book of Psalms 109:23] I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and
[Book of Psalms 109:24] My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of
[Book of Psalms 109:25] I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me
[Book of Psalms 109:26] Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:
[Book of Psalms 109:27] That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast
[Book of Psalms 109:28] Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be
[Book of Psalms 109:29] Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover
[Book of Psalms 109:30] I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will
[Book of Psalms 109:31] For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him
[Book of Psalms 110:1] The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I
[Book of Psalms 110:2] The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule
[Book of Psalms 110:3] Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the
[Book of Psalms 110:4] The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for
[Book of Psalms 110:5] The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day
[Book of Psalms 110:6] He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with
[Book of Psalms 110:7] He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift
[Book of Psalms 111:1] Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart,
[Book of Psalms 111:2] The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that
[Book of Psalms 111:3] His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness
[Book of Psalms 111:4] He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is
[Book of Psalms 111:5] He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be
[Book of Psalms 111:6] He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may
[Book of Psalms 111:7] The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his
[Book of Psalms 111:8] They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and
[Book of Psalms 111:9] He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his
[Book of Psalms 111:10] The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good
[Book of Psalms 112:1] Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD,
[Book of Psalms 112:2] His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the
[Book of Psalms 112:3] Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness
[Book of Psalms 112:4] Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is
[Book of Psalms 112:5] A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his
[Book of Psalms 112:6] Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in
[Book of Psalms 112:7] He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed,
[Book of Psalms 112:8] His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see
[Book of Psalms 112:9] He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness
[Book of Psalms 112:10] The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with
[Book of Psalms 113:1] Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise
[Book of Psalms 113:2] Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for
[Book of Psalms 113:3] From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the
[Book of Psalms 113:4] The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the
[Book of Psalms 113:5] Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,
[Book of Psalms 113:6] Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven,
[Book of Psalms 113:7] He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy
[Book of Psalms 113:8] That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his
[Book of Psalms 113:9] He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful
[Book of Psalms 114:1] When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people
[Book of Psalms 114:2] Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.
[Book of Psalms 114:3] The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
[Book of Psalms 114:4] The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like
[Book of Psalms 114:5] What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan,
[Book of Psalms 114:6] Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills,
[Book of Psalms 114:7] Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the
[Book of Psalms 114:8] Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a
[Book of Psalms 115:1] Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory,
[Book of Psalms 115:2] Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?
[Book of Psalms 115:3] But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath
[Book of Psalms 115:4] Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.
[Book of Psalms 115:5] They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they
[Book of Psalms 115:6] They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they
[Book of Psalms 115:7] They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they
[Book of Psalms 115:8] They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that
[Book of Psalms 115:9] O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their
[Book of Psalms 115:10] O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their
[Book of Psalms 115:11] Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
[Book of Psalms 115:12] The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will
[Book of Psalms 115:13] He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.
[Book of Psalms 115:14] The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your
[Book of Psalms 115:15] Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.
[Book of Psalms 115:16] The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD’s: but the earth
[Book of Psalms 115:17] The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into
[Book of Psalms 115:18] But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for
[Book of Psalms 116:1] I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my
[Book of Psalms 116:2] Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call
[Book of Psalms 116:3] The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat
[Book of Psalms 116:4] Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee,
[Book of Psalms 116:5] Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.
[Book of Psalms 116:6] The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped
[Book of Psalms 116:7] Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt
[Book of Psalms 116:8] For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from
[Book of Psalms 116:9] I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
[Book of Psalms 116:10] I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:
[Book of Psalms 116:11] I said in my haste, All men are liars.
[Book of Psalms 116:12] What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward
[Book of Psalms 116:13] I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the
[Book of Psalms 116:14] I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his
[Book of Psalms 116:15] Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.
[Book of Psalms 116:16] O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son
[Book of Psalms 116:17] I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will
[Book of Psalms 116:18] I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his
[Book of Psalms 116:19] In the courts of the LORD’s house, in the midst of thee, O
[Book of Psalms 117:1] O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.
[Book of Psalms 117:2] For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of
[Book of Psalms 118:1] O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy
[Book of Psalms 118:2] Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
[Book of Psalms 118:3] Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for
[Book of Psalms 118:4] Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for
[Book of Psalms 118:5] I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and
[Book of Psalms 118:6] The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto
[Book of Psalms 118:7] The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall
[Book of Psalms 118:8] It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.
[Book of Psalms 118:9] It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
[Book of Psalms 118:10] All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD
[Book of Psalms 118:11] They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in
[Book of Psalms 118:12] They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the
[Book of Psalms 118:13] Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD
[Book of Psalms 118:14] The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.
[Book of Psalms 118:15] The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of
[Book of Psalms 118:16] The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the
[Book of Psalms 118:17] I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.
[Book of Psalms 118:18] The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over
[Book of Psalms 118:19] Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and
[Book of Psalms 118:20] This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.
[Book of Psalms 118:21] I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my
[Book of Psalms 118:22] The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone
[Book of Psalms 118:23] This is the LORD’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.
[Book of Psalms 118:24] This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and
[Book of Psalms 118:25] Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send
[Book of Psalms 118:26] Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have
[Book of Psalms 118:27] God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice
[Book of Psalms 118:28] Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I
[Book of Psalms 118:29] O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
[Book of Psalms 119:1] Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the
[Book of Psalms 119:2] Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him
[Book of Psalms 119:3] They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.
[Book of Psalms 119:4] Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.
[Book of Psalms 119:5] O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!
[Book of Psalms 119:6] Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy
[Book of Psalms 119:7] I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have
[Book of Psalms 119:8] I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.
[Book of Psalms 119:9] Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed
[Book of Psalms 119:10] With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander
[Book of Psalms 119:11] Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against
[Book of Psalms 119:12] Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.
[Book of Psalms 119:13] With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.
[Book of Psalms 119:14] I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in
[Book of Psalms 119:15] I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy
[Book of Psalms 119:16] I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy
[Book of Psalms 119:17] Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep
[Book of Psalms 119:18] Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of
[Book of Psalms 119:19] I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from
[Book of Psalms 119:20] My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy
[Book of Psalms 119:21] Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from
[Book of Psalms 119:22] Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy
[Book of Psalms 119:23] Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did
[Book of Psalms 119:24] Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.
[Book of Psalms 119:25] My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to
[Book of Psalms 119:26] I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy
[Book of Psalms 119:27] Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk
[Book of Psalms 119:28] My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according
[Book of Psalms 119:29] Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law
[Book of Psalms 119:30] I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid
[Book of Psalms 119:31] I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.
[Book of Psalms 119:32] I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge
[Book of Psalms 119:33] Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it
[Book of Psalms 119:34] Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall
[Book of Psalms 119:35] Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I
[Book of Psalms 119:36] Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.
[Book of Psalms 119:37] Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me
[Book of Psalms 119:38] Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.
[Book of Psalms 119:39] Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.
[Book of Psalms 119:40] Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy
[Book of Psalms 119:41] Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation,
[Book of Psalms 119:42] So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me:
[Book of Psalms 119:43] And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I
[Book of Psalms 119:44] So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.
[Book of Psalms 119:45] And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.
[Book of Psalms 119:46] I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not
[Book of Psalms 119:47] And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have
[Book of Psalms 119:48] My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I
[Book of Psalms 119:49] Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused
[Book of Psalms 119:50] This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath
[Book of Psalms 119:51] The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not
[Book of Psalms 119:52] I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted
[Book of Psalms 119:53] Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that
[Book of Psalms 119:54] Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.
[Book of Psalms 119:55] I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept
[Book of Psalms 119:56] This I had, because I kept thy precepts.
[Book of Psalms 119:57] Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy
[Book of Psalms 119:58] I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me
[Book of Psalms 119:59] I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
[Book of Psalms 119:60] I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.
[Book of Psalms 119:61] The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not
[Book of Psalms 119:62] At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy
[Book of Psalms 119:63] I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that
[Book of Psalms 119:64] The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.
[Book of Psalms 119:65] Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto
[Book of Psalms 119:66] Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy
[Book of Psalms 119:67] Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy
[Book of Psalms 119:68] Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.
[Book of Psalms 119:69] The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy
[Book of Psalms 119:70] Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.
[Book of Psalms 119:71] It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might
[Book of Psalms 119:72] The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold
[Book of Psalms 119:73] Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding,
[Book of Psalms 119:74] They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I
[Book of Psalms 119:75] I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in
[Book of Psalms 119:76] Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort,
[Book of Psalms 119:77] Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy
[Book of Psalms 119:78] Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me
[Book of Psalms 119:79] Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have
[Book of Psalms 119:80] Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.
[Book of Psalms 119:81] My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.
[Book of Psalms 119:82] Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?
[Book of Psalms 119:83] For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget
[Book of Psalms 119:84] How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute
[Book of Psalms 119:85] The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.
[Book of Psalms 119:86] All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me
[Book of Psalms 119:87] They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy
[Book of Psalms 119:88] Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the
[Book of Psalms 119:89] For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.
[Book of Psalms 119:90] Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established
[Book of Psalms 119:91] They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all
[Book of Psalms 119:92] Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have
[Book of Psalms 119:93] I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast
[Book of Psalms 119:94] I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.
[Book of Psalms 119:95] The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will
[Book of Psalms 119:96] I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is
[Book of Psalms 119:97] O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.
[Book of Psalms 119:98] Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine
[Book of Psalms 119:99] I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy
[Book of Psalms 119:100] I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy
[Book of Psalms 119:101] I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might
[Book of Psalms 119:102] I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught
[Book of Psalms 119:103] How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey
[Book of Psalms 119:104] Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate
[Book of Psalms 119:105] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.
[Book of Psalms 119:106] I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy
[Book of Psalms 119:107] I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto
[Book of Psalms 119:108] Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O
[Book of Psalms 119:109] My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy
[Book of Psalms 119:110] The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy
[Book of Psalms 119:111] Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they
[Book of Psalms 119:112] I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even
[Book of Psalms 119:113] I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.
[Book of Psalms 119:114] Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.
[Book of Psalms 119:115] Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments
[Book of Psalms 119:116] Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me
[Book of Psalms 119:117] Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect
[Book of Psalms 119:118] Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes:
[Book of Psalms 119:119] Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross:
[Book of Psalms 119:120] My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy
[Book of Psalms 119:121] I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine
[Book of Psalms 119:122] Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress
[Book of Psalms 119:123] Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
[Book of Psalms 119:124] Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me
[Book of Psalms 119:125] I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy
[Book of Psalms 119:126] It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void
[Book of Psalms 119:127] Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine
[Book of Psalms 119:128] Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to
[Book of Psalms 119:129] Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep
[Book of Psalms 119:130] The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth
[Book of Psalms 119:131] I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy
[Book of Psalms 119:132] Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to
[Book of Psalms 119:133] Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have
[Book of Psalms 119:134] Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy
[Book of Psalms 119:135] Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy
[Book of Psalms 119:136] Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy
[Book of Psalms 119:137] Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.
[Book of Psalms 119:138] Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and
[Book of Psalms 119:139] My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten
[Book of Psalms 119:140] Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.
[Book of Psalms 119:141] I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.
[Book of Psalms 119:142] Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law
[Book of Psalms 119:143] Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy
[Book of Psalms 119:144] The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me
[Book of Psalms 119:145] I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy
[Book of Psalms 119:146] I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.
[Book of Psalms 119:147] I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in
[Book of Psalms 119:148] Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in
[Book of Psalms 119:149] Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD,
[Book of Psalms 119:150] They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from
[Book of Psalms 119:151] Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.
[Book of Psalms 119:152] Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast
[Book of Psalms 119:153] Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget
[Book of Psalms 119:154] Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy
[Book of Psalms 119:155] Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy
[Book of Psalms 119:156] Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to
[Book of Psalms 119:157] Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline
[Book of Psalms 119:158] I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept
[Book of Psalms 119:159] Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD,
[Book of Psalms 119:160] Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy
[Book of Psalms 119:161] Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart
[Book of Psalms 119:162] I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.
[Book of Psalms 119:163] I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.
[Book of Psalms 119:164] Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous
[Book of Psalms 119:165] Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall
[Book of Psalms 119:166] LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy
[Book of Psalms 119:167] My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them
[Book of Psalms 119:168] I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways
[Book of Psalms 119:169] Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me
[Book of Psalms 119:170] Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to
[Book of Psalms 119:171] My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy
[Book of Psalms 119:172] My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments
[Book of Psalms 119:173] Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.
[Book of Psalms 119:174] I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my
[Book of Psalms 119:175] Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy
[Book of Psalms 119:176] I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I
[Book of Psalms 120:1] In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.
[Book of Psalms 120:2] Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful
[Book of Psalms 120:3] What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee,
[Book of Psalms 120:4] Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
[Book of Psalms 120:5] Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents
[Book of Psalms 120:6] My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.
[Book of Psalms 120:7] I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.
[Book of Psalms 121:1] I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my
[Book of Psalms 121:2] My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.
[Book of Psalms 121:3] He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee
[Book of Psalms 121:4] Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
[Book of Psalms 121:5] The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right
[Book of Psalms 121:6] The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
[Book of Psalms 121:7] The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve
[Book of Psalms 121:8] The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from
[Book of Psalms 122:1] I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of
[Book of Psalms 122:2] Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
[Book of Psalms 122:3] Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:
[Book of Psalms 122:4] Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the
[Book of Psalms 122:5] For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house
[Book of Psalms 122:6] Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love
[Book of Psalms 122:7] Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.
[Book of Psalms 122:8] For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be
[Book of Psalms 122:9] Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
[Book of Psalms 123:1] Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the
[Book of Psalms 123:2] Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
[Book of Psalms 123:3] Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are
[Book of Psalms 123:4] Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that
[Book of Psalms 124:1] If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel
[Book of Psalms 124:2] If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose
[Book of Psalms 124:3] Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was
[Book of Psalms 124:4] Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our
[Book of Psalms 124:5] Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
[Book of Psalms 124:6] Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their
[Book of Psalms 124:7] Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:
[Book of Psalms 124:8] Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
[Book of Psalms 125:1] They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot
[Book of Psalms 125:2] As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round
[Book of Psalms 125:3] For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
[Book of Psalms 125:4] Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are
[Book of Psalms 125:5] As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD
[Book of Psalms 126:1] When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like
[Book of Psalms 126:2] Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
[Book of Psalms 126:3] The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.
[Book of Psalms 126:4] Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.
[Book of Psalms 126:5] They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
[Book of Psalms 126:6] He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
[Book of Psalms 127:1] Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build
[Book of Psalms 127:2] It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the
[Book of Psalms 127:3] Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the
[Book of Psalms 127:4] As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of
[Book of Psalms 127:5] Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall
[Book of Psalms 128:1] Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his
[Book of Psalms 128:2] For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou
[Book of Psalms 128:3] Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine
[Book of Psalms 128:4] Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the
[Book of Psalms 128:5] The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the
[Book of Psalms 128:6] Yea, thou shalt see thy children’s children, and peace upon
[Book of Psalms 129:1] Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now
[Book of Psalms 129:2] Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have
[Book of Psalms 129:3] The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.
[Book of Psalms 129:4] The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the
[Book of Psalms 129:5] Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
[Book of Psalms 129:6] Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth
[Book of Psalms 129:7] Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth
[Book of Psalms 129:8] Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be
[Book of Psalms 130:1] Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.
[Book of Psalms 130:2] Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of
[Book of Psalms 130:3] If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
[Book of Psalms 130:4] But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
[Book of Psalms 130:5] I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I
[Book of Psalms 130:6] My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the
[Book of Psalms 130:7] Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy,
[Book of Psalms 130:8] And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
[Book of Psalms 131:1] Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I
[Book of Psalms 131:2] Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is
[Book of Psalms 131:3] Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
[Book of Psalms 132:1] Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:
[Book of Psalms 132:2] How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of
[Book of Psalms 132:3] Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go
[Book of Psalms 132:4] I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,
[Book of Psalms 132:5] Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the
[Book of Psalms 132:6] Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the
[Book of Psalms 132:7] We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his
[Book of Psalms 132:8] Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.
[Book of Psalms 132:9] Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy
[Book of Psalms 132:10] For thy servant David’s sake turn not away the face of thine
[Book of Psalms 132:11] The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from
[Book of Psalms 132:12] If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I
[Book of Psalms 132:13] For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his
[Book of Psalms 132:14] This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired
[Book of Psalms 132:15] I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor
[Book of Psalms 132:16] I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints
[Book of Psalms 132:17] There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a
[Book of Psalms 132:18] His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall
[Book of Psalms 133:1] Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
[Book of Psalms 133:2] It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down
[Book of Psalms 133:3] As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the
[Book of Psalms 134:1] Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which by
[Book of Psalms 134:2] Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.
[Book of Psalms 134:3] The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.
[Book of Psalms 135:1] Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him,
[Book of Psalms 135:2] Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the
[Book of Psalms 135:3] Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his
[Book of Psalms 135:4] For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his
[Book of Psalms 135:5] For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above
[Book of Psalms 135:6] Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in
[Book of Psalms 135:7] He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he
[Book of Psalms 135:8] Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.
[Book of Psalms 135:9] Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,
[Book of Psalms 135:10] Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;
[Book of Psalms 135:11] Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the
[Book of Psalms 135:12] And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel
[Book of Psalms 135:13] Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD,
[Book of Psalms 135:14] For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself
[Book of Psalms 135:15] The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men’s
[Book of Psalms 135:16] They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they
[Book of Psalms 135:17] They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath
[Book of Psalms 135:18] They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that
[Book of Psalms 135:19] Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of
[Book of Psalms 135:20] Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless
[Book of Psalms 135:21] Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem.
[Book of Psalms 136:1] O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
[Book of Psalms 136:2] O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for
[Book of Psalms 136:3] O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for
[Book of Psalms 136:4] To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for
[Book of Psalms 136:5] To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth
[Book of Psalms 136:6] To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his
[Book of Psalms 136:7] To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever:
[Book of Psalms 136:8] The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:
[Book of Psalms 136:9] The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for
[Book of Psalms 136:10] To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy
[Book of Psalms 136:11] And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth
[Book of Psalms 136:12] With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy
[Book of Psalms 136:13] To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy
[Book of Psalms 136:14] And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy
[Book of Psalms 136:15] But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his
[Book of Psalms 136:16] To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his
[Book of Psalms 136:17] To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for
[Book of Psalms 136:18] And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:
[Book of Psalms 136:19] Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:
[Book of Psalms 136:20] And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:
[Book of Psalms 136:21] And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for
[Book of Psalms 136:22] Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy
[Book of Psalms 136:23] Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for
[Book of Psalms 136:24] And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth
[Book of Psalms 136:25] Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.
[Book of Psalms 136:26] O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth
[Book of Psalms 137:1] By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when
[Book of Psalms 137:2] We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.
[Book of Psalms 137:3] For there they that carried us away captive required of us a
[Book of Psalms 137:4] How shall we sing the LORD’s song in a strange land?
[Book of Psalms 137:5] If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
[Book of Psalms 137:6] If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of
[Book of Psalms 137:7] Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem;
[Book of Psalms 137:8] O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he
[Book of Psalms 137:9] Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
[Book of Psalms 138:1] I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I
[Book of Psalms 138:2] I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for
[Book of Psalms 138:3] In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst
[Book of Psalms 138:4] All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they
[Book of Psalms 138:5] Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the
[Book of Psalms 138:6] Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but
[Book of Psalms 138:7] Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou
[Book of Psalms 138:8] The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O
[Book of Psalms 139:1] O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.
[Book of Psalms 139:2] Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou
[Book of Psalms 139:3] Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted
[Book of Psalms 139:4] For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou
[Book of Psalms 139:5] Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon
[Book of Psalms 139:6] Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot
[Book of Psalms 139:7] Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from
[Book of Psalms 139:8] If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in
[Book of Psalms 139:9] If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost
[Book of Psalms 139:10] Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall
[Book of Psalms 139:11] If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night
[Book of Psalms 139:12] Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth
[Book of Psalms 139:13] For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my
[Book of Psalms 139:14] I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
[Book of Psalms 139:15] My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret,
[Book of Psalms 139:16] Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in
[Book of Psalms 139:17] How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is
[Book of Psalms 139:18] If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand:
[Book of Psalms 139:19] Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me
[Book of Psalms 139:20] For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take
[Book of Psalms 139:21] Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I
[Book of Psalms 139:22] I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
[Book of Psalms 139:23] Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my
[Book of Psalms 139:24] And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the
[Book of Psalms 140:1] Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the
[Book of Psalms 140:2] Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they
[Book of Psalms 140:3] They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders’ poison
[Book of Psalms 140:4] Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from
[Book of Psalms 140:5] The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a
[Book of Psalms 140:6] I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my
[Book of Psalms 140:7] O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered
[Book of Psalms 140:8] Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his
[Book of Psalms 140:9] As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief
[Book of Psalms 140:10] Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the
[Book of Psalms 140:11] Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall
[Book of Psalms 140:12] I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
[Book of Psalms 140:13] Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the
[Book of Psalms 141:1] Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my
[Book of Psalms 141:2] Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the
[Book of Psalms 141:3] Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
[Book of Psalms 141:4] Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works
[Book of Psalms 141:5] Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him
[Book of Psalms 141:6] When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall
[Book of Psalms 141:7] Our bones are scattered at the grave’s mouth, as when one
[Book of Psalms 141:8] But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my
[Book of Psalms 141:9] Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the
[Book of Psalms 141:10] Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal
[Book of Psalms 142:1] I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD
[Book of Psalms 142:2] I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my
[Book of Psalms 142:3] When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my
[Book of Psalms 142:4] I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that
[Book of Psalms 142:5] I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my
[Book of Psalms 142:6] Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from
[Book of Psalms 142:7] Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the
[Book of Psalms 143:1] Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy
[Book of Psalms 143:2] And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight
[Book of Psalms 143:3] For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life
[Book of Psalms 143:4] Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me
[Book of Psalms 143:5] I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse
[Book of Psalms 143:6] I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after
[Book of Psalms 143:7] Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face
[Book of Psalms 143:8] Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee
[Book of Psalms 143:9] Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide
[Book of Psalms 143:10] Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is
[Book of Psalms 143:11] Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name’s sake: for thy righteousness’
[Book of Psalms 143:12] And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them
[Book of Psalms 144:1] Blessed be the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war,
[Book of Psalms 144:2] My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer;
[Book of Psalms 144:3] LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son
[Book of Psalms 144:4] Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth
[Book of Psalms 144:5] Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and
[Book of Psalms 144:6] Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows,
[Book of Psalms 144:7] Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great
[Book of Psalms 144:8] Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right
[Book of Psalms 144:9] I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an

[Book of Psalms 144:14] That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no
[Book of Psalms 144:15] Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is
[Book of Psalms 145:1] I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for
[Book of Psalms 145:2] Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever
[Book of Psalms 145:3] Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness
[Book of Psalms 145:4] One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall
[Book of Psalms 145:5] I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy
[Book of Psalms 145:6] And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I
[Book of Psalms 145:7] They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness,
[Book of Psalms 145:8] The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and
[Book of Psalms 145:9] The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his
[Book of Psalms 145:10] All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall
[Book of Psalms 145:11] They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy
[Book of Psalms 145:12] To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the
[Book of Psalms 145:13] Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion
[Book of Psalms 145:14] The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that
[Book of Psalms 145:15] The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat
[Book of Psalms 145:16] Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every
[Book of Psalms 145:17] The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his
[Book of Psalms 145:18] The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that
[Book of Psalms 145:19] He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will
[Book of Psalms 145:20] The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked
[Book of Psalms 145:21] My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh
[Book of Psalms 146:1] Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.
[Book of Psalms 146:2] While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my
[Book of Psalms 146:3] Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom
[Book of Psalms 146:4] His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very
[Book of Psalms 146:5] Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope
[Book of Psalms 146:6] Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is:
[Book of Psalms 146:7] Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to
[Book of Psalms 146:8] The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them
[Book of Psalms 146:9] The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless
[Book of Psalms 146:10] The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all
[Book of Psalms 147:1] Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God;
[Book of Psalms 147:2] The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the
[Book of Psalms 147:3] He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.
[Book of Psalms 147:4] He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their
[Book of Psalms 147:5] Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is
[Book of Psalms 147:6] The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the
[Book of Psalms 147:7] Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp
[Book of Psalms 147:8] Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the
[Book of Psalms 147:9] He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which
[Book of Psalms 147:10] He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not
[Book of Psalms 147:11] The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that
[Book of Psalms 147:12] Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.
[Book of Psalms 147:13] For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed
[Book of Psalms 147:14] He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the
[Book of Psalms 147:15] He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth
[Book of Psalms 147:16] He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like
[Book of Psalms 147:17] He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his
[Book of Psalms 147:18] He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind
[Book of Psalms 147:19] He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments
[Book of Psalms 147:20] He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments,
[Book of Psalms 148:1] Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise
[Book of Psalms 148:2] Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.
[Book of Psalms 148:3] Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.
[Book of Psalms 148:4] Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above
[Book of Psalms 148:5] Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they
[Book of Psalms 148:6] He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a
[Book of Psalms 148:7] Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:
[Book of Psalms 148:8] Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his
[Book of Psalms 148:9] Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:
[Book of Psalms 148:10] Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:
[Book of Psalms 148:11] Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of
[Book of Psalms 148:12] Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:
[Book of Psalms 148:13] Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is
[Book of Psalms 148:14] He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his
[Book of Psalms 149:1] Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his
[Book of Psalms 149:2] Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of
[Book of Psalms 149:3] Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises
[Book of Psalms 149:4] For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the
[Book of Psalms 149:5] Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon
[Book of Psalms 149:6] Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged
[Book of Psalms 149:7] To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the
[Book of Psalms 149:8] To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters
[Book of Psalms 149:9] To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all
[Book of Psalms 150:1] Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in
[Book of Psalms 150:2] Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his
[Book of Psalms 150:3] Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the
[Book of Psalms 150:4] Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed
[Book of Psalms 150:5] Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high
[Book of Psalms 150:6] Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.

[Proverbs 2:1] My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments
[Proverbs 2:6] For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and

[Proverbs 4:25] Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight
[Proverbs 4:26] Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.
[Proverbs 4:27] Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from

[Proverbs 20:9] Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?
[Proverbs 20:10] Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike
[Proverbs 20:11] Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure,

[Proverbs 31:16] She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her
[Proverbs 31:17] She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.
[Proverbs 31:18] She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth
[Proverbs 31:19] She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the
[Proverbs 31:20] She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth
[Proverbs 31:21] She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her
[Proverbs 31:22] She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk
[Proverbs 31:23] Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the
[Proverbs 31:24] She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles
[Proverbs 31:25] Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in
[Proverbs 31:26] She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law
[Proverbs 31:27] She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not
[Proverbs 31:28] Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,
[Proverbs 31:29] Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them
[Proverbs 31:30] Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that
[Proverbs 31:31] Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise
[Preacher 1:1] The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
[Preacher 1:2] Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is
[Preacher 1:3] What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the
[Preacher 1:5] The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his
[Preacher 1:6] The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north;
[Preacher 1:7] All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the
[Preacher 1:8] All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not
[Preacher 1:9] The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that
[Preacher 1:10] Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it
[Preacher 1:11] There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be
[Preacher 1:12] I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
[Preacher 1:13] And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning
[Preacher 1:14] I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and,
[Preacher 1:15] That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is
[Preacher 1:16] I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great
[Preacher 1:17] And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and
[Preacher 1:18] For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth
[Preacher 2:1] I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,
[Preacher 2:2] I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? 2:3 I
[Preacher 2:4] I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me
[Preacher 2:9] So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in
[Preacher 2:10] And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld
[Preacher 2:11] Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on
[Preacher 2:12] And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for
[Preacher 2:13] Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth
[Preacher 2:14] The wise man’s eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in
[Preacher 2:15] Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it
[Preacher 2:16] For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for
[Preacher 2:17] Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under
[Preacher 2:18] Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:
[Preacher 2:19] And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet
[Preacher 2:20] Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the
[Preacher 2:21] For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge,
[Preacher 2:22] For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his
[Preacher 2:24] There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and
[Preacher 2:25] For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?
[Preacher 2:26] For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and
[Preacher 3:1] To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose
[Preacher 3:9] What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?
[Preacher 3:10] I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men
[Preacher 3:11] He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set
[Preacher 3:12] I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice,
[Preacher 3:13] And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good
[Preacher 3:14] I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing
[Preacher 3:15] That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already
[Preacher 3:16] And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that
[Preacher 3:17] I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the
[Preacher 3:18] I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men,
[Preacher 3:19] For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even
[Preacher 3:20] All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust
[Preacher 3:21] Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit
[Preacher 4:2] Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the
[Preacher 4:3] Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who
[Preacher 4:4] Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for
[Preacher 4:5] The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
[Preacher 4:6] Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with
[Preacher 4:7] Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.
[Preacher 4:8] There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath
[Preacher 4:9] Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their
[Preacher 4:10] For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him
[Preacher 4:11] Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one
[Preacher 4:13] Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king,
[Preacher 4:14] For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is
[Preacher 4:15] I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the
[Preacher 4:16] There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been
[Preacher 5:1] Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more
[Preacher 5:2] Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to
[Preacher 5:3] For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool’s
[Preacher 5:4] When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath
[Preacher 5:5] Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest
[Preacher 5:6] Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou
[Preacher 5:8] If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting
[Preacher 5:9] Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is
[Preacher 5:10] He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he
[Preacher 5:11] When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what
[Preacher 5:13] There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,
[Preacher 5:14] But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son,
[Preacher 5:15] As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to
[Preacher 5:16] And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so
[Preacher 5:17] All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow
[Preacher 5:18] Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to
[Preacher 5:19] Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath
[Preacher 5:20] For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God
[Preacher 6:1] There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common
[Preacher 6:3] If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that
[Preacher 6:4] For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his
[Preacher 6:5] Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath
[Preacher 6:6] Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen
[Preacher 6:8] For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor,
[Preacher 6:10] That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is
[Preacher 6:11] Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the
[Preacher 7:2] It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the
[Preacher 7:3] Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the
[Preacher 7:4] The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart
[Preacher 7:5] It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to
[Preacher 7:6] For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of
[Preacher 7:7] Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the
[Preacher 7:8] Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the
[Preacher 7:9] Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the
[Preacher 7:10] Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better
[Preacher 7:11] Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to
[Preacher 7:12] For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the
[Preacher 7:13] Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which
[Preacher 7:15] All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just
[Preacher 7:16] Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why
[Preacher 7:19] Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are
[Preacher 7:20] For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
[Preacher 7:21] Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear
[Preacher 7:23] All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it
[Preacher 7:24] That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
[Preacher 7:25] I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out
[Preacher 7:27] Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by
[Preacher 7:29] Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but
[Preacher 8:1] Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a
[Preacher 8:2] I counsel thee to keep the king’s commandment, and that in regard
[Preacher 8:3] Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing;
[Preacher 8:4] Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto
[Preacher 8:6] Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the
[Preacher 8:7] For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when
[Preacher 8:9] All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is
[Preacher 8:10] And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the
[Preacher 8:11] Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
[Preacher 8:12] Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be
[Preacher 8:14] There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be
[Preacher 8:15] Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under
[Preacher 8:16] When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business
[Preacher 9:1] For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this,
[Preacher 9:2] All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous,
[Preacher 9:3] This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that
[Preacher 9:4] For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a
[Preacher 9:5] For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any
[Preacher 9:6] Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now
[Preacher 9:7] Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a
[Preacher 9:8] Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no
[Preacher 9:9] Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the
[Preacher 9:10] Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for
[Preacher 9:11] I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the
[Preacher 9:12] For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken
[Preacher 9:13] This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great
[Preacher 9:16] Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the
[Preacher 9:17] The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him
[Preacher 9:18] Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth
[Preacher 10:1] Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a
[Preacher 10:2] A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at
[Preacher 10:3] Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom
[Preacher 10:4] If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy
[Preacher 10:5] There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error
[Preacher 10:7] I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants
[Preacher 10:8] He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an
[Preacher 10:9] Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that
[Preacher 10:10] If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he
[Preacher 10:11] Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler
[Preacher 10:12] The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a
[Preacher 10:13] The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the
[Preacher 10:14] A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be;
[Preacher 10:16] Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes
[Preacher 10:19] A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money
[Preacher 10:20] Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the
[Preacher 11:1] Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many
[Preacher 11:2] Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not
[Preacher 11:3] If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the
[Preacher 11:4] He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth
[Preacher 11:5] As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the
[Preacher 11:6] In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not
[Preacher 11:7] Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes
[Preacher 11:9] Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee
[Preacher 11:10] Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from
[Preacher 12:1] Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil
[Preacher 12:7] Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit
[Preacher 12:8] Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.
[Preacher 12:9] And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the
[Preacher 12:10] The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which
[Preacher 12:11] The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the
[Preacher 12:12] And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many
[Preacher 12:13] Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and
[Preacher 12:14] For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret
[Song of Solomon 1:1] The song of songs, which is Solomon’s.
[Song of Solomon 1:2] Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is
[Song of Solomon 1:3] Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as
[Song of Solomon 1:4] Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his
[Song of Solomon 1:5] I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents
[Song of Solomon 1:6] Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked
[Song of Solomon 1:7] Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where
[Song of Solomon 1:9] I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in
[Song of Solomon 1:10] Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains
[Song of Solomon 1:11] We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.
[Song of Solomon 1:12] While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth
[Song of Solomon 1:13] A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all
[Song of Solomon 1:14] My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards
[Song of Solomon 1:15] Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast
[Song of Solomon 1:16] Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is
[Song of Solomon 1:17] The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.
[Song of Solomon 2:1] I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.
[Song of Solomon 2:2] As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.
[Song of Solomon 2:3] As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved
[Song of Solomon 2:4] He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was
[Song of Solomon 2:5] Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of
[Song of Solomon 2:6] His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace
[Song of Solomon 2:7] I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the
[Song of Solomon 2:8] The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the
[Song of Solomon 2:9] My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth
[Song of Solomon 2:10] My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair
[Song of Solomon 2:11] For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; 2:12 The
[Song of Solomon 2:14] O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret
[Song of Solomon 2:15] Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for
[Song of Solomon 2:16] My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.
[Song of Solomon 2:17] Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved,
[Song of Solomon 3:1] By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him,
[Song of Solomon 3:2] I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the
[Song of Solomon 3:3] The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw
[Song of Solomon 3:5] I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the
[Song of Solomon 3:6] Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of
[Song of Solomon 3:8] They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his
[Song of Solomon 3:9] King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.
[Song of Solomon 3:10] He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of
[Song of Solomon 3:11] Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with
[Song of Solomon 4:1] Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast
[Song of Solomon 4:2] Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which
[Song of Solomon 4:3] Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely:
[Song of Solomon 4:4] Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury,
[Song of Solomon 4:5] Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed
[Song of Solomon 4:6] Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to
[Song of Solomon 4:7] Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.
[Song of Solomon 4:8] Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look
[Song of Solomon 4:9] Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast
[Song of Solomon 4:10] How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is
[Song of Solomon 4:11] Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are
[Song of Solomon 4:12] A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a
[Song of Solomon 4:13] Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits;
[Song of Solomon 4:16] Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden,
[Song of Solomon 5:1] I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my
[Song of Solomon 5:2] I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that
[Song of Solomon 5:3] I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my
[Song of Solomon 5:5] I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh,
[Song of Solomon 5:6] I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and
[Song of Solomon 5:7] The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me,
[Song of Solomon 5:8] I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved,
[Song of Solomon 5:9] What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest
[Song of Solomon 5:11] His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black
[Song of Solomon 5:12] His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed
[Song of Solomon 5:13] His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips
[Song of Solomon 5:14] His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as
[Song of Solomon 5:15] His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold:
[Song of Solomon 5:16] His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my
[Song of Solomon 6:1] Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither
[Song of Solomon 6:2] My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to
[Song of Solomon 6:3] I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the
[Song of Solomon 6:4] Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem,
[Song of Solomon 6:5] Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair
[Song of Solomon 6:6] Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing,
[Song of Solomon 6:7] As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.
[Song of Solomon 6:8] There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins
[Song of Solomon 6:9] My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her
[Song of Solomon 6:10] Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon,
[Song of Solomon 6:12] Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of
[Song of Solomon 6:13] Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look
[Song of Solomon 7:1] How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince’s daughter! the
[Song of Solomon 7:2] Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy
[Song of Solomon 7:3] Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.
[Song of Solomon 7:4] Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in
[Song of Solomon 7:5] Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head
[Song of Solomon 7:6] How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! 7:7
[Song of Solomon 7:8] I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the
[Song of Solomon 7:10] I am my beloved’s, and his desire is toward me.
[Song of Solomon 7:11] Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in
[Song of Solomon 7:12] Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine
[Song of Solomon 7:13] The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of
[Song of Solomon 8:1] O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my
[Song of Solomon 8:2] I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother’s house, who
[Song of Solomon 8:3] His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should
[Song of Solomon 8:4] I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor
[Song of Solomon 8:5] Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her
[Song of Solomon 8:6] Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for
[Song of Solomon 8:7] Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it:
[Song of Solomon 8:8] We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do
[Song of Solomon 8:10] I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes
[Song of Solomon 8:11] Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto
[Song of Solomon 8:12] My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must
[Song of Solomon 8:13] Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy
[Song of Solomon 8:14] Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:1] The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:2] Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:3] The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:4] Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:5] Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:6] From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:7] Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:8] And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:9] Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:10] Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:11] To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:12] When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:14] Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:15] And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:16] Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:18] Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:19] If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:20] But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:21] How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:22] Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water: 1:23 Thy
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:24] Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:27] Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:28] And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:29] For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:30] For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 1:31] And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 2:1] The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 2:2] And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 2:3] And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 2:4] And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 2:5] O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 2:6] Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 2:7] Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 2:10] Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 2:11] The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 2:12] For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 2:17] And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 2:18] And the idols he shall utterly abolish.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 2:19] And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 2:20] In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 2:22] Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:2] The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:4] And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:5] And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:6] When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:8] For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:9] The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:10] Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:11] Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:12] As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:13] The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:14] The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:15] What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:16] Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:18] In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:20] The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:22] The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:24] And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:25] Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 3:26] And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 4:1] And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 4:2] In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 4:3] And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 4:5] And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 4:6] And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:1] Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:2] And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:3] And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:4] What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:7] For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:8] Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:10] Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:11] Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:13] Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:14] Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:15] And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:17] Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:18] Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:25] Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:26] And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 5:30] And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 6:1] In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting upon
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 6:2] Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 6:3] And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 6:4] And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 6:5] Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 6:6] Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 6:8] Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 6:9] And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 6:10] Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 6:11] Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 6:13] But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:1] And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:2] And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:3] Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:5] Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:8] For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:9] And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:10] Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying, 7:11 Ask thee a
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:12] But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:13] And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:15] Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:16] For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:17] The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:18] And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:19] And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:20] In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:21] And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:23] And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:24] With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 7:25] And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:1] Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:2] And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:3] And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:4] For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:5] The LORD spake also unto me again, saying, 8:6 Forasmuch as this
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:9] Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:10] Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:11] For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:13] Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:14] And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:15] And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:16] Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:17] And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:18] Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:19] And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:21] And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 8:22] And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:1] Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:2] The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:3] Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:4] For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:5] For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:6] For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:7] Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:8] The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:9] And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:11] Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:13] For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:14] Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:15] The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:16] For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:17] Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men, neither
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:18] For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:19] Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 9:20] And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:1] Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:3] And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:5] O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:6] I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:7] Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:8] For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings? 10:9 Is not
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:13] For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:15] Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:16] Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:17] And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:19] And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:20] And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:21] The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:22] For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:23] For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:24] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:25] For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:26] And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:27] And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:28] He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:30] Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:31] Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:32] As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:33] Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 10:34] And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 11:1] And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 11:5] And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 11:6] The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 11:7] And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 11:8] And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 11:9] They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 11:10] And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 11:11] And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 11:12] And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 11:13] The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 11:14] But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 11:15] And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 11:16] And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 12:1] And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 12:2] Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 12:3] Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 12:4] And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 12:5] Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 12:6] Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:1] The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:2] Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:3] I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:4] The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:5] They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:6] Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:7] Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man’s heart shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:9] Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:10] For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:11] And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:12] I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:13] Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:14] And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:15] Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:16] Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes;
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:17] Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:18] Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:19] And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees’
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:20] It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:21] But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 13:22] And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:1] For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:2] And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:3] And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:6] He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:7] The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:8] Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:9] Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:10] All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:12] How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:13] For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:15] Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:16] They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:19] But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:20] Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:21] Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:22] For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:23] I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:24] The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:25] That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:26] This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:27] For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it?
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:29] Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:30] And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:31] Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 14:32] What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 15:1] The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 15:3] In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 15:4] And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 15:5] My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 15:6] For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 15:7] Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 15:8] For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 15:9] For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 16:1] Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 16:2] For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 16:3] Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 16:4] Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 16:5] And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 16:6] We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 16:7] Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 16:8] For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 16:9] Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 16:10] And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field;
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 16:11] Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 16:12] And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 16:13] This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 16:14] But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 17:1] The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 17:2] The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 17:3] The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 17:4] And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 17:5] And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 17:6] Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 17:7] At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 17:8] And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 17:9] In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 17:10] Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 17:12] Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 17:14] And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 18:1] Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 18:4] For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 18:5] For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 18:6] They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 18:7] In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:1] The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:2] And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:3] And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:4] And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord;
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:5] And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:6] And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:7] The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:8] The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:9] Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:10] And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:11] Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:13] The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:14] The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:15] Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:16] In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:17] And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:18] In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:19] In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:20] And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:21] And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:22] And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it: and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:23] In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 19:24] In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 20:1] In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the king
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 20:3] And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 20:5] And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 20:6] And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 21:2] A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 21:3] Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 21:4] My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 21:5] Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 21:6] For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 21:7] And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 21:10] O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 21:11] The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 21:13] The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 21:14] The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 21:15] For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 21:16] For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, according to
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:1] The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:3] All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:4] Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:5] For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:6] And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:7] And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:8] And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look in
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:9] Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:10] And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:11] Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:12] And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:14] And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:15] Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:18] He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:19] And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:20] And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:22] And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder;
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:23] And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:24] And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father’s
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 22:25] In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:1] The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:2] Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:3] And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:4] Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:5] As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely pained
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:6] Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:7] Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:8] Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:10] Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:11] He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:12] And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:13] Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:14] Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:15] And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:16] Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:17] And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 23:18] And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:1] Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:2] And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:3] The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:4] The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:5] The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:6] Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:7] The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:8] The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:9] They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:10] The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:11] There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:12] In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:13] When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:14] They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:15] Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:16] From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:17] Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:18] And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:19] The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:20] The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:21] And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:22] And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 24:23] Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 25:1] O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 25:2] For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 25:3] Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 25:4] For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 25:5] Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 25:6] And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 25:7] And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 25:8] He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 25:9] And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 25:10] For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 25:11] And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 25:12] And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:1] In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:2] Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:3] Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:4] Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:6] The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:7] The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:8] Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:9] With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:10] Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:11] LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:12] LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:13] O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:14] They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:15] Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:16] LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:17] Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:18] We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:19] Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:20] Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 26:21] For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 27:1] In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 27:2] In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 27:3] I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 27:4] Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against me
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 27:5] Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 27:6] He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 27:7] Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is he
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 27:9] By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 27:10] Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 27:11] When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 27:12] And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall beat
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 27:13] And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:1] Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:3] The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:5] In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:7] But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:8] For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:9] Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:10] For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:12] To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:13] But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:14] Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:15] Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:17] Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:18] And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:19] From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:20] For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:21] For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:22] Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:23] Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:24] Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:27] For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:28] Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 28:29] This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:1] Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:2] Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:3] And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:4] And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:5] Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:6] Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:7] And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:8] It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:9] Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:10] For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:11] And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:13] Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:15] Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:19] The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:20] For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:22] Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:23] But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 29:24] They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:1] Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:4] For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:5] They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:6] The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:7] For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:8] Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:12] Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:13] Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:14] And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters’ vessel
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:15] For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:16] But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:17] One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:18] And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:19] For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:20] And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:22] Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:23] Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:24] The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:25] And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:26] Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:27] Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:29] Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:30] And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:31] For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:32] And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 30:33] For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared;
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 31:1] Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 31:3] Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 31:4] For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 31:5] As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem;
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 31:6] Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 31:7] For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 31:8] Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man;
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 31:9] And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:1] Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:2] And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:3] And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:4] The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:5] The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:6] For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:7] The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:8] But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:9] Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:10] Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:11] Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:12] They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:13] Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:16] Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:17] And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:18] And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 32:20] Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:1] Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:2] O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:3] At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:4] And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:5] The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:6] And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:7] Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:8] The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:9] The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:10] Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:11] Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:12] And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:13] Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:14] The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:17] Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:18] Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:20] Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:21] But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:22] For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:23] Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 33:24] And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:1] Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:2] For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his fury
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:3] Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:4] And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:5] For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:6] The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:7] And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:8] For it is the day of the LORD’s vengeance, and the year of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:9] And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:10] It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:11] But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:12] They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:13] And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:14] The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:15] There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:16] Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 34:17] And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 35:1] The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 35:2] It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 35:3] Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 35:4] Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 35:5] Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 35:6] Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 35:7] And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 35:8] And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 35:9] No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 36:1] Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 36:2] And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 36:3] Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, which was over
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 36:4] And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 36:7] But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 36:8] Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 36:9] How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 36:11] Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 36:12] But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 36:14] Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 36:15] Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 36:16] Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 36:18] Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will deliver
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 36:22] Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:1] And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:2] And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:3] And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:4] It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:5] So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:6] And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:7] Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:8] So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:9] And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:11] Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:12] Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:15] And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying, 37:16 O LORD of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:17] Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:18] Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:20] Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:21] Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:23] Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:24] By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:25] I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:26] Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:27] Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:28] But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:29] Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:30] And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:31] And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:33] Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:34] By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:35] For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:36] Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:37] So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 37:38] And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:1] In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:2] Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:4] Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying, 38:5 Go, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:6] And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:7] And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:9] The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:11] I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:12] Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd’s
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:13] I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:14] Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:15] What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:16] O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:17] Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:18] For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:19] The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:20] The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:21] For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 38:22] Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 39:2] And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 39:3] Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 39:4] Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 39:5] Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 39:6] Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 39:7] And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 39:8] Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:1] Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:2] Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:3] The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:4] Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:6] The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:7] The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:8] The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:9] O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:11] He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:12] Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:16] And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:17] All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:18] To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:20] He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:21] Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:23] That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:24] Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:25] To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:26] Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:27] Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:29] He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 40:30] Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:1] Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew their
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:2] Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:3] He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:4] Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:5] The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:6] They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:7] So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:8] But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:9] Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:10] Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:11] Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:12] Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:13] For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:14] Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:15] Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:16] Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:17] When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:18] I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:19] I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:21] Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:22] Let them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:23] Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:24] Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:25] I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:26] Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:27] The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:28] For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 41:29] Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:1] Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:2] He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:3] A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:4] He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:5] Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:8] I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:9] Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:10] Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:11] Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:12] Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:13] The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:14] I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:15] I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:16] And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:17] They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:18] Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:19] Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:21] The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness’ sake; he will
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:22] But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:23] Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 42:25] Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:1] But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:2] When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:3] For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:4] Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:5] Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:8] Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:9] Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:10] Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:11] I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:12] I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:13] Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:15] I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:16] Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:18] Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:19] Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:20] The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:21] This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:22] But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:23] Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:24] Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:25] I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:26] Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:27] Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 43:28] Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:1] Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:2] Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:3] For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:5] One shall say, I am the LORD’s; and another shall call himself by
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:6] Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:7] And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:8] Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:9] They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:10] Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:12] The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:13] The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:14] He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:15] Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:16] He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:18] They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:19] And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:22] I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:23] Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:24] Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 44:26] That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:1] Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:4] For Jacob my servant’s sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:5] I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:7] I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:8] Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:9] Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:12] I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:13] I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:14] Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:15] Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:16] They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:17] But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:18] For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:19] I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:20] Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:21] Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:22] Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:23] I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:24] Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 45:25] In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 46:1] Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 46:2] They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 46:3] Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 46:5] To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 46:7] They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 46:8] Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 46:9] Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 46:12] Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 47:1] Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 47:2] Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 47:3] Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 47:4] As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 47:5] Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 47:6] I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 47:7] And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 47:8] Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 47:10] For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 47:11] Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 47:12] Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 47:13] Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 47:14] Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 47:15] Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:1] Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:2] For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:3] I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:4] Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:6] Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I have
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:7] They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:8] Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:9] For my name’s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:10] Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:11] For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:12] Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:13] Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:14] All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:15] I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:16] Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:17] Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:18] O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:19] Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:20] Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:21] And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 48:22] There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:1] Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:2] And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:4] Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:5] And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:6] And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:7] Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:8] Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:10] They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:11] And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:12] Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:13] Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:14] But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:15] Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:16] Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:17] Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:18] Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:19] For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:20] The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:21] Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:23] And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:24] Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 49:26] And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 50:1] Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother’s
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 50:2] Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 50:3] I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 50:4] The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 50:5] The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 50:6] I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 50:7] For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 50:8] He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 50:9] Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 50:10] Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 50:11] Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 51:1] Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 51:2] Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 51:3] For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 51:4] Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 51:5] My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 51:6] Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 51:7] Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 51:8] For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 51:9] Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 51:12] I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 51:15] But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 51:16] And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 51:17] Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 51:18] There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 51:19] These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 51:21] Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 52:1] Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 52:2] Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 52:3] For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 52:4] For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 52:5] Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 52:6] Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 52:7] How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 52:9] Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 52:10] The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 52:11] Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 52:12] For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 52:13] Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 52:14] As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 53:1] Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 53:3] He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 53:4] Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 53:5] But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 53:6] All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 53:7] He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 53:8] He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 53:9] And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 53:10] Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 53:11] He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 53:12] Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 54:1] Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 54:2] Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 54:4] Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 54:5] For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name;
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 54:6] For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 54:7] For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 54:8] In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 54:9] For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 54:10] For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 54:11] O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 54:12] And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 54:13] And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 54:14] In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 54:15] Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 54:16] Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 54:17] No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 55:1] Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 55:2] Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 55:3] Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 55:4] Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 55:5] Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 55:6] Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 55:8] For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 55:9] For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 55:10] For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 55:12] For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 55:13] Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 56:1] Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 56:2] Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 56:3] Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 56:4] For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 56:5] Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 56:6] Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 56:8] The Lord GOD, which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 56:9] All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 56:10] His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 56:11] Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 56:12] Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:1] The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:2] He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:3] But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:4] Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:5] Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:8] Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:9] And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:10] Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:11] And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:13] When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:15] For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:16] For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:17] For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:18] I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:19] I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:20] But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 57:21] There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 58:1] Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 58:2] Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 58:3] Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 58:4] Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 58:5] Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 58:8] Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 58:9] Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 58:12] And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 58:13] If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:1] Behold, the LORD’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save;
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:3] For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:4] None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:5] They hatch cockatrice’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web: he that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:6] Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:7] Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:8] The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:9] Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:10] We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:11] We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:12] For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:14] And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:15] Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:16] And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:17] For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:18] According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:19] So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:20] And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 59:21] As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:1] Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:2] For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:3] And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:4] Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:5] Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:6] The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:7] All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:8] Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:10] And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:11] Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:12] For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:13] The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:14] The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:15] Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:16] Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:17] For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:18] Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:19] The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:20] Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:21] Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 60:22] A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 61:1] The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 61:4] And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 61:5] And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 61:6] But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 61:7] For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 61:8] For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering;
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 61:9] And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 61:10] I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 61:11] For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 62:1] For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 62:2] And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 62:3] Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 62:4] Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 62:5] For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 62:6] I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 62:8] The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 62:10] Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 62:11] Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 62:12] And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 63:1] Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 63:2] Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 63:4] For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 63:5] And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 63:6] And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 63:7] I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 63:8] For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 63:9] In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 63:10] But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 63:11] Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 63:15] Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 63:17] O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 63:18] The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 63:19] We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 64:1] Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 64:4] For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 64:5] Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 64:6] But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 64:7] And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 64:8] But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 64:9] Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 64:10] Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 64:11] Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 64:12] Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:2] I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:3] A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:5] Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:6] Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:8] Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:9] And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:10] And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:11] But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:12] Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:13] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:15] And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:17] For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:18] But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:19] And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:20] There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:21] And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:22] They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:23] They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:24] And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer;
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 65:25] The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:1] Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:3] He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:4] I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:5] Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:6] A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:7] Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:8] Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:9] Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:10] Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:12] For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:13] As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:14] And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:15] For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:16] For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh:
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:17] They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:18] For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:19] And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:20] And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:21] And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:22] For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:23] And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another,
[Book of the Prophet Isaiah 66:24] And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:1] The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:3] It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:4] Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 1:5 Before I
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:6] Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:7] But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:8] Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:9] Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:10] See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:11] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:12] Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:13] And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:14] Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:15] For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:16] And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:17] Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:18] For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 1:19] And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:1] Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 2:2 Go and cry
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:3] Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:4] Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:7] And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:8] The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:9] Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:10] For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:11] Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:12] Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:13] For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:14] Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled?
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:15] The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:16] Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:17] Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:20] For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:21] Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:23] How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:25] Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst:
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:26] As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:27] Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:28] But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:29] Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:30] In vain have I smitten your children; they received no
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:31] O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:33] Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:34] Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:35] Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:36] Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 2:37] Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:1] They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:2] Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:3] Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:4] Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:6] The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:7] And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me.
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:8] And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:9] And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:10] And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:11] And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:12] Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:13] Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:14] Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:16] And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:17] At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD;
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:18] In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:19] But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:20] Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:21] A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:22] Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:23] Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:24] For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth;
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 3:25] We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:1] If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me: and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:2] And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:3] For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:4] Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:5] Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:6] Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:7] The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:8] For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:9] And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:10] Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:11] At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:13] Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:14] O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:16] Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:17] As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:18] Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:19] My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:20] Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:21] How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:23] I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:24] I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:25] I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:26] I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:27] For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate;
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:28] For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black;
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:29] The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:30] And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 4:31] For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:1] Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:2] And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:3] O LORD, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:4] Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:5] I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:6] Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:7] How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:8] They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:9] Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: and shall not
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:11] For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:12] They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither shall
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:14] Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:15] Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:16] Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:17] And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:18] Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:19] And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:20] Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:24] Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:25] Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:26] For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:27] As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit:
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:28] They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 5:29] Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:2] I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:3] The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:4] Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:5] Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:6] For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:7] As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:8] Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee;
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:9] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:10] To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear?
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:11] Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:12] And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:13] For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:14] They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:15] Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:16] Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:17] Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:18] Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:19] Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:20] To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:21] Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:22] Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:23] They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:24] We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:25] Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:26] O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:27] I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:28] They are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they are
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:29] The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 6:30] Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the LORD hath
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:1] The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 7:2 Stand in
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:3] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:4] Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:5] For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:8] Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:9] Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:10] And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:12] But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:13] And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:15] And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:16] Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:17] Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:19] Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: do they not provoke
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:21] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:22] For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:24] But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:25] Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:27] Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:28] But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:29] Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:30] For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:31] And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:32] Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:33] And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 7:34] Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:1] At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:3] And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:4] Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:6] I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:7] Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:8] How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us?
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:9] The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:11] For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:12] Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:13] I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:14] Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:15] We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:17] For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:18] When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:19] Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:21] For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black;
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 8:22] Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 9:3] And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 9:4] Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 9:5] And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 9:6] Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 9:7] Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 9:9] Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall not
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 9:11] And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 9:12] Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 9:16] I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 9:17] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 9:19] For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled!
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 9:20] Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 9:21] For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 9:22] Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 9:23] Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 9:25] Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:1] Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:3] For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:4] They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:5] They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:6] Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:7] Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:8] But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:9] Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:10] But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:11] Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:12] He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:13] When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:14] Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:15] They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:16] The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:17] Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:18] For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:19] Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:20] My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:21] For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:22] Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:23] O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:24] O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 10:25] Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:1] The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying, 11:2 Hear ye
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:6] Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:7] For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:8] Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:9] And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:10] They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:11] Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:12] Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:13] For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:14] Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:15] What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:16] The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:17] For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:18] And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:19] But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter;
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:20] But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 11:21] Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 12:1] Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 12:2] Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 12:3] But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 12:4] How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 12:5] If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 12:7] I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 12:8] Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 12:9] Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 12:10] Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 12:11] They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 12:12] The spoilers are come upon all high places through the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 12:13] They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 12:14] Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 12:15] And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 12:16] And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 12:17] But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:1] Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:2] So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:3] And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:4] Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:5] So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:6] And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:7] Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:8] Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 13:9 Thus saith
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:10] This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:11] For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:12] Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:14] And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:15] Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken.
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:16] Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:17] But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:18] Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down:
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:19] The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:20] Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north:
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:23] Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:24] Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:25] This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:26] Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 13:27] I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:2] Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:3] And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:4] Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:5] Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:6] And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:7] O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:8] O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:10] Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:11] Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:12] When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:13] Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:14] Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:15] Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:16] And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:17] Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:18] If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:19] Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:21] Do not abhor us, for thy name’s sake, do not disgrace the throne
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 14:22] Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:1] Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:2] And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:3] And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:4] And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:5] For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:7] And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:8] Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:9] She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:10] Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:11] The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:12] Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel? 15:13 Thy
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:14] And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:15] O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:16] Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:17] I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:18] Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:20] And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 15:21] And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 16:1] The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying, 16:2 Thou shalt
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 16:3] For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 16:5] For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 16:6] Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 16:8] Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 16:9] For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 16:10] And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 16:11] Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 16:14] Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 16:16] Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 16:17] For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 16:18] And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double;
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 16:19] O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 16:20] Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods? 16:21
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:1] The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:3] O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and all thy
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:4] And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:5] Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:6] For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:7] Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:8] For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:9] The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked:
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:11] As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:12] A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:13] O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:14] Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:15] Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:16] As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:17] Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil.
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:18] Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:19] Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:22] Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:23] But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:24] And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:25] Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:26] And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 17:27] But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:1] The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 18:2
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:3] Then I went down to the potter’s house, and, behold, he wrought a
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:4] And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:5] Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 18:6 O house of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:7] At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:9] And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:11] Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:12] And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:13] Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:14] Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:17] I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:18] Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah;
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:19] Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:20] Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:21] Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:22] Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 18:23] Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me:
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 19:1] Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter’s earthen bottle, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 19:4] Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 19:6] Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 19:7] And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 19:8] And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 19:9] And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 19:10] Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 19:12] Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 19:14] Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:1] Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:2] Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:3] And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:4] For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:5] Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:6] And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:7] O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived; thou art
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:8] For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil;
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:9] Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:10] For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:11] But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:12] But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:13] Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:14] Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:15] Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:16] And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 20:18] Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 21:3] Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: 21:4
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 21:5] And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 21:6] And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 21:7] And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 21:8] And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 21:9] He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 21:10] For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 21:11] And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 21:13] Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:1] Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:4] For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:5] But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:6] For thus saith the LORD unto the king’s house of Judah; Thou art
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:7] And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:8] And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:10] Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep sore for
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:11] For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:13] Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:15] Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:17] But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:18] Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:20] Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:21] I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:22] The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:23] O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:26] And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:27] But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:28] Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 22:30] Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:1] Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:2] Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:3] And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:4] And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:5] Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:6] In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely:
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:7] Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:9] Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:10] For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:11] For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:12] Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:13] And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:14] I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing:
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:15] Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets;
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:16] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:17] They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:18] For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:19] Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:20] The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:21] I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:22] But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:23] Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off?
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:24] Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him?
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:25] I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:26] How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:28] The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:29] Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:31] Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:32] Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:33] And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:34] And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:35] Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:37] Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 23:40] And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 24:1] The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 24:2] One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 24:3] Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 24:4] Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 24:5 Thus saith
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 24:6] For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 24:7] And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 24:8] And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil;
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 24:10] And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:1] The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:4] And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:5] They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:7] Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:8] Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:10] Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:11] And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment;
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:12] And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:13] And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:14] For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:15] For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:16] And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:17] Then took I the cup at the LORD’s hand, and made all the nations
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:25] And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:27] Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:28] And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:29] For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:30] Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:31] A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:32] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:33] And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:34] Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:35] And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:36] A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:37] And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 25:38] He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:1] In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:3] If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:4] And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:7] So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:8] Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:9] Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:10] When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:11] Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:12] Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:13] Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:14] As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:15] But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:16] Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:17] Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:19] Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:20] And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:21] And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:22] And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:23] And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 26:24] Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 27:1] In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 27:6] And now have I given all these lands into the hand of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 27:7] And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 27:8] And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 27:9] Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 27:10] For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 27:11] But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 27:12] I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 27:13] Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 27:15] For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 27:16] Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 27:17] Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live:
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 27:19] For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 27:20] Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 28:1] And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 28:3] Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 28:5] Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 28:7] Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 28:9] The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 28:10] Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 28:11] And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 28:12] Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 28:14] For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 28:15] Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 28:16] Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 28:17] So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:1] Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:7] And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:8] For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:9] For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:10] For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:11] For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:12] Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:13] And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:14] And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:15] Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:18] And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:20] Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:24] Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:25] Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:27] Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:29] And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 29:30] Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 29:31 Send
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:1] The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 30:2 Thus
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:3] For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:4] And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:5] For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:6] Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child?
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:8] For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:10] Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD;
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:11] For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:12] For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:13] There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up:
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:14] All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:15] Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:16] Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:17] For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:18] Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:19] And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:20] Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:21] And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:22] And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:23] Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 30:24] The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he hath
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:1] At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:2] Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:3] The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:4] Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:5] Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:6] For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:7] For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:8] Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:9] They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:10] Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:11] For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:12] Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:13] Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:14] And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:15] Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:16] Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:17] And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:18] I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:19] Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:20] Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:21] Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:22] How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:23] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:24] And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:25] For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:26] Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:27] Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:28] And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:29] In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:30] But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:31] Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:34] And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:35] Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:37] Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:38] Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:39] And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:40] And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:1] The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:2] For then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem: and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:3] For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:4] And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:6] And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:7] Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:8] So Hanameel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:9] And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle’s son, that was in
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:10] And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:11] So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:13] And I charged Baruch before them, saying, 32:14 Thus saith the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:15] For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:16] Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:18] Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:25] And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:26] Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 32:27
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:30] For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:31] For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:33] And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:34] But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:35] And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:36] And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:41] Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:42] For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:43] And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 32:44] Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:1] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:4] For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:6] Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:7] And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:8] And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:9] And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:10] Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:11] The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:12] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:13] In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:14] Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:15] In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:16] In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:17] For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:19] And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying, 33:20 Thus
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:22] As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:23] Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 33:24
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 33:25] Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 34:1] The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 34:4] Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 34:6] Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 34:8] This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 34:10] Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 34:11] But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 34:12] Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 34:15] And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 34:17] Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 34:18] And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 34:21] And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 34:22] Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 35:1] The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 35:3] Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 35:6] But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 35:8] Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 35:10] But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 35:11] But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 35:12] Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 35:13 Thus
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 35:14] The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 35:15] I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 35:16] Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 35:18] And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:1] And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:3] It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:4] Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:5] And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:7] It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:8] And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:9] And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:10] Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:11] When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:13] Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:14] Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:15] And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears.
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:16] Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:17] And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:19] Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:20] And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:21] So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:22] Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:23] And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:24] Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:25] Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:26] But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:27] Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:29] And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:31] And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 36:32] Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:1] And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:2] But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:3] And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:4] Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:5] Then Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:6] Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah saying,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:7] Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:8] And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:9] Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:10] For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:11] And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:13] And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:14] Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:15] Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:16] When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:18] Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 37:21] Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:1] Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:3] Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:4] Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:5] Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:6] Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:7] Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:10] Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:11] So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:12] And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:13] So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:14] Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:15] Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:17] Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:18] But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:19] And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:20] But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:21] But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:23] So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:24] Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:25] But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:27] Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 38:28] So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 39:1] In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 39:2] And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 39:3] And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 39:4] And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 39:5] But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 39:6] Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 39:7] Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 39:8] And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 39:9] Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 39:10] But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 39:11] Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 39:13] So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban,
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 39:15] Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 39:17] But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 39:18] For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 40:1] The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that
[Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 40:2] And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him,
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 40:3] Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath said:
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 40:4] And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 40:5] Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 40:6] Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 40:7] Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields,
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 40:9] And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 40:10] As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 40:11] Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 40:13] Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 40:15] Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 41:1] Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 41:2] Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 41:3] Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 41:4] And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah,
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 41:6] And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 41:7] And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 41:8] But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 41:9] Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 41:10] Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 41:11] But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 41:13] Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 41:14] So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 41:15] But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 41:16] Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 42:1] Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 42:4] Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you;
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 42:5] Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 42:6] Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 42:7] And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 42:8] Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 42:11] Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 42:12] And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 42:13] But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 42:17] So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 42:18] For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 42:19] The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 42:20] For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 42:21] And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 42:22] Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 43:1] And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 43:2] Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 43:4] So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces,
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 43:5] But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 43:6] Even men, and women, and children, and the king’s daughters, and
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 43:7] So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 43:8] Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 43:11] And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 43:12] And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 43:13] He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:1] The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:3] Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:4] Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:5] But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:6] Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:7] Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:11] Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:12] And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:13] For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:15] Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:17] But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:18] But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven,
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:19] And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:23] Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:24] Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:26] Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:27] Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:28] Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 44:29] And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 45:1] The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 45:4] Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 45:5] And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for,
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:1] The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:3] Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:4] Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:5] Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:6] Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:7] Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:9] Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:10] For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:11] Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:12] The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:13] The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:14] Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:15] Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:16] He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said,
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:17] They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:18] As I live, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts,
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:19] O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:20] Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:21] Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks;
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:22] The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:23] They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:24] The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:25] The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:27] But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 46:28] Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I am with
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 47:1] The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 47:2] Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 47:3] At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses,
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 47:4] Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, and
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 47:5] Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 47:7] How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 48:1] Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 48:2] There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 48:3] A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 48:4] Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 48:5] For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 48:6] Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 48:7] For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures,
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 48:8] And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 48:9] Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 48:10] Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 48:11] Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 48:12] Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 48:13] And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 48:14] How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war? 48:15
[LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 48:16] The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth

[Lamentations of Jeremiah 1:20] Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled;
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 1:21] They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 1:22] Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 2:1] How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his

[Lamentations of Jeremiah 2:19] Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 2:20] Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 2:22] Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so

[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:16] He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:17] And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:18] And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:19] Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:20] My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:21] This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:22] It is of the LORD’s mercies that we are not consumed, because his
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:23] They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:24] The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:25] The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:26] It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:27] It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:28] He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:29] He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:30] He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:31] For the LORD will not cast off for ever: 3:32 But though he cause
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:33] For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:34] To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:35] To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:37] Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:41] Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:42] We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:43] Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain,
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:44] Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:45] Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:46] All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:47] Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:48] Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:49] Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:50] Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:51] Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:52] Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:53] They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:54] Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:55] I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:56] Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:57] Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:58] O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:59] O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:60] Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:61] Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:63] Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:64] Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:65] Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 3:66] Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:1] How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:2] The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:3] Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:4] The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:5] They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:6] For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:7] Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk,
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:9] They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:10] The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children:
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:11] The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:12] The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world,
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:13] For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests,
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:15] They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart,
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:16] The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:17] As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:18] They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:19] Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:20] The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:21] Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:22] The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:1] Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:2] Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:3] We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:4] We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:5] Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:6] We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:7] Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:8] Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:9] We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:10] Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:11] They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:12] Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:13] They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:14] The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:15] The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:16] The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:18] Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:19] Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:20] Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long
[Lamentations of Jeremiah 5:22] But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:1] Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:2] In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:4] And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:5] Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:6] And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:7] And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:8] And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:9] Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:10] As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:11] Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:12] And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:13] As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:14] And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:15] Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:16] The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:17] When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:18] As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:19] And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:20] Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:21] When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:22] And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:23] And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:24] And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:25] And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:26] And above the firmament that was over their heads was the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:27] And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 1:28] As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 2:1] And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 2:2] And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 2:3] And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 2:4] For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 2:5] And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 2:6] And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 2:7] And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 2:8] But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 2:9] And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:1] Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:2] So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:3] And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:4] And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:5] For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:7] But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:8] Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:9] As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:10] Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:11] And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:12] Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:13] I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:14] So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:15] Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:16] And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:18] When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:19] Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:20] Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:21] Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:22] And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:23] Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:24] Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:25] But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:26] And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 3:27] But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 4:1] Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 4:3] Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 4:4] Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 4:5] For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 4:6] And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 4:7] Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 4:8] And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 4:9] Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 4:10] And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 4:11] Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 4:12] And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 4:13] And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 4:14] Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 4:15] Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 4:16] Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 5:1] And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 5:2] Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 5:3] Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 5:4] Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 5:5] Thus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 5:6] And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 5:7] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 5:9] And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 5:10] Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 5:11] Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 5:12] A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 5:13] Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 5:14] Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 5:15] So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 5:16] When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 6:1] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 6:2 Son of man, set
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 6:3] And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 6:4] And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 6:5] And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 6:6] In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 6:7] And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 6:8] Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 6:9] And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 6:10] And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 6:11] Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 6:12] He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 6:13] Then shall ye know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 6:14] So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:1] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 7:2 Also, thou
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:3] Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:4] And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:5] Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:6] An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:7] The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:8] Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:9] And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:10] Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:11] Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:12] The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:13] For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:14] They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:15] The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:16] But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:17] All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:18] They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:19] They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:20] As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:21] And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:22] My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:23] Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:24] Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:25] Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:26] Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 7:27] The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:1] And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:2] Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:3] And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:4] And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:5] Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:6] He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do?
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:7] And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:8] Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:9] And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:10] So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:11] And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:12] Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:13] He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:14] Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD’s house
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:15] Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:16] And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD’s house, and,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:17] Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 8:18] Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 9:1] He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 9:2] And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 9:3] And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 9:4] And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 9:5] And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 9:7] And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 9:8] And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 9:10] And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 9:11] And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:1] Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:2] And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:3] Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:4] Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:5] And the sound of the cherubims’ wings was heard even to the outer
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:6] And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:7] And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:8] And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man’s hand
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:9] And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:10] And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:11] When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:12] And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:13] As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:14] And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:15] And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:16] And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:17] When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:18] Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:19] And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:20] This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:21] Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 10:22] And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:1] Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:2] Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:4] Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:5] And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:6] Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:7] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:8] Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:9] And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:10] Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:11] This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:13] And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:15] Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:16] Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:17] Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:18] And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:19] And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:21] But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:22] Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:23] And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:24] Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 11:25] Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:1] The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying, 12:2 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:3] Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:4] Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:5] Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:6] In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:7] And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:8] And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:9] Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:11] Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:12] And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:13] My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:14] And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:15] And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:16] But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:17] Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 12:18 Son of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:20] And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:21] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 12:22 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:24] For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:25] For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:26] Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:27] Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 12:28] Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 13:1] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 13:2 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 13:5] Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 13:6] They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 13:7] Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 13:9] And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 13:10] Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 13:12] Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 13:14] So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 13:15] Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 13:17] Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 13:21] Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 13:22] Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 13:23] Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 14:1] Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 14:2] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 14:3 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 14:5] That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 14:6] Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 14:7] For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 14:9] And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 14:10] And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 14:12] The word of the LORD came again to me, saying, 14:13 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 14:15] If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 14:17] Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 14:19] Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 14:21] For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 14:22] Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 14:23] And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 15:1] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 15:2 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 15:4] Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 15:7] And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 15:8] And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:1] Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 16:2 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:4] And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:5] None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:6] And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:7] I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:8] Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:9] Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:10] I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:11] I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:12] And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:13] Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:14] And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:15] But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:16] And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:17] Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:19] My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:20] Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:23] And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:25] Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:26] Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:27] Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:28] Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:29] Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:30] How weak is thine heart, saith the LORD GOD, seeing thou doest
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:33] They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:34] And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:35] Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD: 16:36 Thus saith
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:38] And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:39] And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:40] They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:41] And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:42] So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:43] Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:44] Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:45] Thou art thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her husband and her
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:46] And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:47] Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:48] As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:49] Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:50] And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:51] Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:52] Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:53] When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:55] When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:56] For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:58] Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:59] For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:60] Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:61] Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 16:62] And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 17:1] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 17:2 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 17:5] He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 17:6] And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 17:7] There was also another great eagle with great wings and many
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 17:8] It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 17:9] Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 17:10] Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 17:11] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 17:12 Say
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 17:15] But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 17:17] Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 17:19] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 17:20] And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 17:21] And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 17:22] Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 17:24] And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:1] The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, 18:2 What mean
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:4] Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:5] But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, 18:6
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:10] If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:14] Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father’s sins
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:18] As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:19] Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:20] The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:21] But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:22] All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:23] Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:24] But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:25] Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O house
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:27] Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:28] Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:29] Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not equal.
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:30] Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 18:31] Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 19:1] Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 19:2] And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 19:3] And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 19:4] The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 19:5] Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 19:6] And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 19:7] And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 19:8] Then the nations set against him on every side from the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 19:9] And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 19:10] Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 19:11] And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 19:12] But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 19:13] And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 19:14] And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:1] And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:2] Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying, 20:3 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:4] Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:8] But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:9] But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:10] Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:11] And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:12] Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:13] But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:14] But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:15] Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:17] Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:18] But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:21] Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:22] Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name’s
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:23] I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:25] Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:27] Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:28] For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:29] Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go?
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:30] Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:32] And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:33] As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:35] And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:36] Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:37] And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:39] As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:40] For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:41] I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:42] And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:43] And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:44] And ye shall know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:45] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 20:46 Son of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:48] And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 20:49] Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:4] Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:6] Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:7] And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou?
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:8] Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 21:9 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:11] And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:12] Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:13] Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:14] Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:15] I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:16] Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:17] I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:18] The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, 21:19 Also,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:20] Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:21] For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:22] At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:23] And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:24] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:25] And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:27] I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:28] And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:30] Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:31] And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 21:32] Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:1] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 22:2 Now,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:3] Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:4] Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:5] Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:6] Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:7] In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:8] Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:9] In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:10] In thee have they discovered their fathers’ nakedness: in thee
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:11] And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:12] In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:13] Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:14] Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:15] And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:16] And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:17] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 22:18 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:19] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:20] As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:21] Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:22] As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:23] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 22:24 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:25] There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:26] Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:27] Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:28] And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:29] The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:30] And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 22:31] Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:1] The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 23:2 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:4] And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:5] And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:7] Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:8] Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:9] Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:10] These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:11] And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:12] She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:13] Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:14] And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:16] And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:17] And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:18] So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:19] Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:20] For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:21] Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:22] Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:24] And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:25] And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:26] They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:27] Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:28] For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:30] I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:31] Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:32] Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:33] Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:34] Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:35] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:36] The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:38] Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:39] For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:40] And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:42] And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:43] Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:45] And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:46] For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:47] And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:48] Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 23:49] And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:1] Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:3] And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:5] Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:6] Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:7] For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:9] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:10] Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:11] Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:12] She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:13] In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:14] I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:15] Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 24:16 Son of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:17] Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:18] So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:19] And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:22] And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:23] And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:24] Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 24:25] Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 25:1] The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 25:2 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 25:5] And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 25:6] For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 25:8] Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 25:11] And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 25:12] Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 25:14] And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 25:15] Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 25:17] And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 26:1] And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 26:4] And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 26:5] It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 26:6] And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 26:7] For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 26:8] He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 26:9] And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 26:10] By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 26:11] With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 26:12] And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 26:13] And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 26:14] And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 26:15] Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 26:17] And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 26:19] For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:1] The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 27:2 Now, thou
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:4] Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:5] They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:6] Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:7] Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:8] The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:9] The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:10] They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:11] The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:12] Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:13] Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they traded
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:14] They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:15] The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:16] Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:17] Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants: they
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:18] Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:19] Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:20] Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:21] Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:22] The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants: they
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:23] Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:24] These were thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:25] The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:26] Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:27] Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:28] The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:29] And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:32] And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:34] In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:35] All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 27:36] The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:1] The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 28:2 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:4] With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:8] They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:9] Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:10] Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:11] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 28:12 Son of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:13] Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:14] Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:15] Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:16] By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:17] Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:18] Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:19] All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:20] Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 28:21 Son of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:23] For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:24] And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:25] Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 28:26] And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:1] In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:4] But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:5] And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:6] And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:7] When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:8] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:9] And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:10] Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:11] No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:12] And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:13] Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:14] And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:15] It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:16] And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:17] And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:20] I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 29:21] In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:1] The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 30:2 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:3] For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:4] And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:5] Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:6] Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:7] And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:8] And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:9] In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:10] Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of Egypt
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:11] He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:12] And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:13] Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:14] And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:15] And I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:16] And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:17] The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:18] At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:19] Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:20] And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:22] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against Pharaoh
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:23] And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:24] And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:25] But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 30:26] And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 31:1] And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 31:4] The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 31:5] Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 31:6] All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 31:7] Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 31:8] The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 31:9] I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 31:10] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 31:12] And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 31:13] Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 31:15] Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 31:16] I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 31:17] They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 31:18] To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:1] And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:3] Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:4] Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:5] And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:6] I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:7] And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:8] All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:9] I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:10] Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:11] For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:12] By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:13] I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:14] Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:15] When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:16] This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:17] It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:19] Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:20] They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:21] The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:22] Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:24] There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:25] They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:26] There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:27] And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:28] Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:29] There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:30] There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:31] Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 32:32] For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:1] Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 33:2 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:4] Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:5] He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:6] But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:7] So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:8] When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:9] Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:10] Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:13] When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:14] Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:16] None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:17] Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:18] When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:19] But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:20] Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:21] And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:22] Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:23] Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 33:24 Son of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:25] Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:28] For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:29] Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:30] Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:31] And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:32] And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 33:33] And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:1] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 34:2 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:4] The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:5] And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:6] My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:7] Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; 34:8 As I
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:11] For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:12] As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:13] And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:14] I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:15] I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:16] I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:17] And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:18] Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:20] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:21] Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:22] Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:23] And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:24] And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:25] And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:26] And I will make them and the places round about my hill a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:27] And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:28] And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:29] And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:30] Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 34:31] And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 35:1] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 35:2 Son of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 35:4] I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 35:5] Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 35:7] Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 35:8] And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 35:9] I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 35:10] Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 35:12] And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 35:13] Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 35:14] Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 35:15] As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:1] Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:6] Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:8] But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:9] For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:12] Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:13] Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:15] Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:16] Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 36:17 Son of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:18] Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:20] And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:21] But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:22] Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:23] And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:24] For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:25] Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:26] A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:27] And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:28] And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:29] I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:30] And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:31] Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:32] Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:33] Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:34] And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:35] And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:36] Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:37] Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 36:38] As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:1] The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:3] And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:4] Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:5] Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:7] So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:8] And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:9] Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:10] So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:11] Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:12] Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:13] And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:15] The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 37:16 Moreover,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:18] And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:20] And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:21] And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:23] Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:24] And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:25] And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:26] Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:27] My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 37:28] And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 38:1] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 38:2 Son of man,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 38:7] Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 38:8] After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 38:9] Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 38:10] Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 38:13] Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 38:14] Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 38:17] Thus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 38:19] For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 38:21] And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 38:22] And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 38:23] Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:1] Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:4] Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:5] Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:6] And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:7] So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:8] Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this is
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:9] And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:11] And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:12] And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:13] Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:14] And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:15] And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:16] And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:17] And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto every
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:18] Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:19] And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:20] Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:21] And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:22] So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:23] And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:24] According to their uncleanness and according to their
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:25] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:27] When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 39:29] Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:1] In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:2] In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:3] And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:4] And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:5] And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:6] Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:7] And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:8] He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:9] Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:10] And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:11] And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:12] The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:13] He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:14] He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:15] And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:16] And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:17] Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:18] And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:19] Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:20] And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:21] And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:22] And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:23] And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:24] After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:25] And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:26] And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:27] And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:28] And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:30] And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:31] And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:32] And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:33] And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:34] And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:35] And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:37] And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:38] And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:39] And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:40] And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:41] Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:42] And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:43] And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:44] And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:45] And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:46] And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:47] So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:48] And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 40:49] The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:1] Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:2] And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:3] Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:4] So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:5] After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:6] And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:7] And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:8] I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:9] The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:10] And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:11] And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:12] Now the building that was before the separate place at the end
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:13] So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:15] And he measured the length of the building over against the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:18] And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:20] From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:21] The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:22] The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:23] And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:24] And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:25] And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 41:26] And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:1] Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:2] Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:3] Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:4] And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:5] Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:6] For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:7] And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:8] For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:9] And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:10] The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:11] And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:12] And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:13] Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:14] When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:15] Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:16] He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:17] He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:18] He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:19] He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 42:20] He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:1] Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:3] And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:4] And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:5] So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:6] And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:7] And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:8] In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:9] Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:10] Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:11] And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:12] This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:13] And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:14] And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:15] So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:16] And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:17] And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:18] And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:19] And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:20] And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:21] Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:22] And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:23] When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:24] And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:25] Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:26] Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 43:27] And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:1] Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:2] Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:3] It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:4] Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:5] And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:6] And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:8] And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:9] Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:10] And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:11] Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:12] Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:13] And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:14] But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:15] But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:17] And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:18] They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:19] And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:20] Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:21] Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:22] Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:23] And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:24] And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:25] And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:26] And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:27] And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:28] And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:29] They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:30] And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 44:31] The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:1] Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:2] Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:3] And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:4] The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:5] And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:6] And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:7] And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:8] In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:9] Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:10] Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:11] The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:12] And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:13] This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:16] All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:17] And it shall be the prince’s part to give burnt offerings, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:18] Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:20] And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:21] In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:22] And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:23] And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:24] And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 45:25] In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:1] Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:2] And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:3] Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:4] And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:5] And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:6] And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:7] And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:8] And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:9] But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:10] And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:11] And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:12] Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:13] Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:14] And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:15] Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:16] Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:17] But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:18] Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:19] After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:20] Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:21] Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:22] In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:23] And there was a row of building round about in them, round about
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 46:24] Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 47:1] Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and,
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 47:2] Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 47:3] And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 47:4] Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters;
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 47:5] Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 47:6] And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 47:7] Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 47:8] Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 47:9] And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 47:10] And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 47:11] But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not

[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 47:13] Thus saith the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby ye
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 47:14] And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 47:15] And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side,

[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 47:21] So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 47:22] And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an

[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 48:31] And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 48:32] And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 48:33] And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures:
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 48:34] At the west side four thousand and five hundred, with their
[Book of the Prophet Ezekiel 48:35] It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of
[Book of Daniel 1:1] In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
[Book of Daniel 1:2] And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part
[Book of Daniel 1:3] And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that
[Book of Daniel 1:5] And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat,
[Book of Daniel 1:6] Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah,
[Book of Daniel 1:8] But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself
[Book of Daniel 1:9] Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the
[Book of Daniel 1:10] And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord
[Book of Daniel 1:11] Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had
[Book of Daniel 1:13] Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the
[Book of Daniel 1:14] So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
[Book of Daniel 1:15] And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and
[Book of Daniel 1:16] Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine
[Book of Daniel 1:17] As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in
[Book of Daniel 1:18] Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring
[Book of Daniel 1:19] And the king communed with them; and among them all was found
[Book of Daniel 1:20] And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king
[Book of Daniel 1:21] And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.
[Book of Daniel 2:1] And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar
[Book of Daniel 2:2] Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the
[Book of Daniel 2:3] And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit
[Book of Daniel 2:4] Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for
[Book of Daniel 2:5] The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone
[Book of Daniel 2:6] But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall
[Book of Daniel 2:7] They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the
[Book of Daniel 2:8] The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain
[Book of Daniel 2:9] But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one
[Book of Daniel 2:10] The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a
[Book of Daniel 2:11] And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none
[Book of Daniel 2:12] For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded
[Book of Daniel 2:13] And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and
[Book of Daniel 2:14] Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the
[Book of Daniel 2:16] Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give
[Book of Daniel 2:17] Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to
[Book of Daniel 2:19] Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then
[Book of Daniel 2:20] Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and
[Book of Daniel 2:23] I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast
[Book of Daniel 2:24] Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained
[Book of Daniel 2:25] Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said
[Book of Daniel 2:26] The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was
[Book of Daniel 2:30] But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom
[Book of Daniel 2:31] Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image,
[Book of Daniel 2:32] This image’s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of
[Book of Daniel 2:34] Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which
[Book of Daniel 2:35] Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold,
[Book of Daniel 2:36] This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof
[Book of Daniel 2:37] Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath
[Book of Daniel 2:38] And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the
[Book of Daniel 2:39] And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and
[Book of Daniel 2:40] And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron
[Book of Daniel 2:41] And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay,
[Book of Daniel 2:42] And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay,
[Book of Daniel 2:43] And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall
[Book of Daniel 2:44] And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a
[Book of Daniel 2:45] Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
[Book of Daniel 2:46] Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped
[Book of Daniel 2:47] The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that
[Book of Daniel 2:48] Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great
[Book of Daniel 2:49] Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach,
[Book of Daniel 3:1] Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was
[Book of Daniel 3:2] Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes,
[Book of Daniel 3:3] Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the
[Book of Daniel 3:4] Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people,
[Book of Daniel 3:7] Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the
[Book of Daniel 3:8] Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused
[Book of Daniel 3:9] They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for
[Book of Daniel 3:10] Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear
[Book of Daniel 3:11] And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be
[Book of Daniel 3:12] There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the
[Book of Daniel 3:13] Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring
[Book of Daniel 3:14] Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach,
[Book of Daniel 3:17] If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the
[Book of Daniel 3:18] But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve
[Book of Daniel 3:19] Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage
[Book of Daniel 3:20] And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to
[Book of Daniel 3:21] Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their
[Book of Daniel 3:22] Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the
[Book of Daniel 3:23] And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down
[Book of Daniel 3:24] Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste,
[Book of Daniel 3:25] He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the
[Book of Daniel 3:26] Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery
[Book of Daniel 3:27] And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s
[Book of Daniel 3:28] Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of
[Book of Daniel 3:29] Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and
[Book of Daniel 3:30] Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the
[Book of Daniel 4:1] Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages,
[Book of Daniel 4:2] I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God
[Book of Daniel 4:3] How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his
[Book of Daniel 4:4] I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my
[Book of Daniel 4:6] Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon
[Book of Daniel 4:7] Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and
[Book of Daniel 4:8] But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was
[Book of Daniel 4:10] Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a
[Book of Daniel 4:11] The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached
[Book of Daniel 4:13] I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a
[Book of Daniel 4:17] This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by
[Book of Daniel 4:18] This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O
[Book of Daniel 4:19] Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one
[Book of Daniel 4:20] The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose
[Book of Daniel 4:23] And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down
[Book of Daniel 4:26] And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots;
[Book of Daniel 4:27] Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and
[Book of Daniel 4:28] All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
[Book of Daniel 4:29] At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the
[Book of Daniel 4:30] The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have
[Book of Daniel 4:32] And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be
[Book of Daniel 4:33] The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he
[Book of Daniel 4:34] And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes
[Book of Daniel 4:37] Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of
[Book of Daniel 5:1] Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords,
[Book of Daniel 5:2] Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the
[Book of Daniel 5:3] Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the
[Book of Daniel 5:4] They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of
[Book of Daniel 5:5] In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote
[Book of Daniel 5:6] Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled
[Book of Daniel 5:7] The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans,
[Book of Daniel 5:8] Then came in all the king’s wise men: but they could not read the
[Book of Daniel 5:9] Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was
[Book of Daniel 5:10] Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords
[Book of Daniel 5:13] Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake
[Book of Daniel 5:15] And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in
[Book of Daniel 5:17] Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be
[Book of Daniel 5:18] O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a
[Book of Daniel 5:20] But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride,
[Book of Daniel 5:22] And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart,
[Book of Daniel 5:25] And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,
[Book of Daniel 5:26] This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered
[Book of Daniel 5:27] TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
[Book of Daniel 5:28] PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and
[Book of Daniel 5:29] Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet,
[Book of Daniel 5:30] In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
[Book of Daniel 5:31] And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore
[Book of Daniel 6:1] It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty
[Book of Daniel 6:3] Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes,
[Book of Daniel 6:4] Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against
[Book of Daniel 6:5] Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this
[Book of Daniel 6:6] Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king,
[Book of Daniel 6:7] All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes,
[Book of Daniel 6:8] Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it
[Book of Daniel 6:9] Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.
[Book of Daniel 6:10] Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into
[Book of Daniel 6:11] Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making
[Book of Daniel 6:12] Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the
[Book of Daniel 6:13] Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which
[Book of Daniel 6:14] Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased
[Book of Daniel 6:15] Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king,
[Book of Daniel 6:16] Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him
[Book of Daniel 6:17] And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and
[Book of Daniel 6:18] Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting:
[Book of Daniel 6:19] Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste
[Book of Daniel 6:20] And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice
[Book of Daniel 6:22] My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that
[Book of Daniel 6:23] Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that
[Book of Daniel 6:24] And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had
[Book of Daniel 6:25] Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages,
[Book of Daniel 6:26] I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble
[Book of Daniel 6:27] He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in
[Book of Daniel 6:28] So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign
[Book of Daniel 7:1] In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream
[Book of Daniel 7:2] Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold,
[Book of Daniel 7:3] And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from
[Book of Daniel 7:4] The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till
[Book of Daniel 7:5] And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised
[Book of Daniel 7:6] After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had
[Book of Daniel 7:7] After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast,
[Book of Daniel 7:8] I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them
[Book of Daniel 7:9] I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days
[Book of Daniel 7:10] A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand
[Book of Daniel 7:11] I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the
[Book of Daniel 7:12] As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion
[Book of Daniel 7:13] I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man
[Book of Daniel 7:14] And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that
[Book of Daniel 7:15] I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and
[Book of Daniel 7:16] I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the
[Book of Daniel 7:17] These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall
[Book of Daniel 7:18] But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and
[Book of Daniel 7:19] Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was
[Book of Daniel 7:21] I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and
[Book of Daniel 7:23] Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon
[Book of Daniel 7:24] And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall
[Book of Daniel 7:25] And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall
[Book of Daniel 7:26] But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his
[Book of Daniel 7:27] And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom
[Book of Daniel 7:28] Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my
[Book of Daniel 8:1] In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
[Book of Daniel 8:2] And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was
[Book of Daniel 8:3] Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood
[Book of Daniel 8:4] I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so
[Book of Daniel 8:5] And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on
[Book of Daniel 8:6] And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen
[Book of Daniel 8:7] And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with
[Book of Daniel 8:8] Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong,
[Book of Daniel 8:9] And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed
[Book of Daniel 8:10] And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down
[Book of Daniel 8:11] Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by
[Book of Daniel 8:12] And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason
[Book of Daniel 8:13] Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that
[Book of Daniel 8:15] And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision,
[Book of Daniel 8:16] And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, which
[Book of Daniel 8:17] So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid,
[Book of Daniel 8:18] Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face
[Book of Daniel 8:19] And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the
[Book of Daniel 8:20] The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media
[Book of Daniel 8:21] And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that
[Book of Daniel 8:22] Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four
[Book of Daniel 8:23] And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors
[Book of Daniel 8:24] And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he
[Book of Daniel 8:25] And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in
[Book of Daniel 8:26] And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is
[Book of Daniel 8:27] And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose
[Book of Daniel 9:1] In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of
[Book of Daniel 9:3] And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
[Book of Daniel 9:6] Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which
[Book of Daniel 9:7] O LORD, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion
[Book of Daniel 9:8] O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our
[Book of Daniel 9:9] To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we
[Book of Daniel 9:11] Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing,
[Book of Daniel 9:12] And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and
[Book of Daniel 9:13] As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon
[Book of Daniel 9:14] Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it
[Book of Daniel 9:15] And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out
[Book of Daniel 9:16] O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let
[Book of Daniel 9:17] Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his
[Book of Daniel 9:18] O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and
[Book of Daniel 9:19] O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not,
[Book of Daniel 9:20] And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and
[Book of Daniel 9:22] And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am
[Book of Daniel 9:23] At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth,
[Book of Daniel 9:24] Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy
[Book of Daniel 9:25] Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the
[Book of Daniel 9:26] And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but
[Book of Daniel 9:27] And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in
[Book of Daniel 10:1] In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed
[Book of Daniel 10:2] In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
[Book of Daniel 10:3] I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth,
[Book of Daniel 10:4] And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by
[Book of Daniel 10:7] And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me
[Book of Daniel 10:8] Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there
[Book of Daniel 10:9] Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of
[Book of Daniel 10:10] And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and
[Book of Daniel 10:11] And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand
[Book of Daniel 10:12] Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day
[Book of Daniel 10:13] But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and
[Book of Daniel 10:14] Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy
[Book of Daniel 10:15] And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward
[Book of Daniel 10:16] And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched
[Book of Daniel 10:17] For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord?
[Book of Daniel 10:18] Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of
[Book of Daniel 10:20] Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now
[Book of Daniel 10:21] But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of
[Book of Daniel 11:1] Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to
[Book of Daniel 11:2] And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up
[Book of Daniel 11:3] And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great
[Book of Daniel 11:4] And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and
[Book of Daniel 11:5] And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his
[Book of Daniel 11:6] And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for
[Book of Daniel 11:7] But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his
[Book of Daniel 11:9] So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall
[Book of Daniel 11:10] But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude
[Book of Daniel 11:11] And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall
[Book of Daniel 11:12] And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be
[Book of Daniel 11:13] For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a
[Book of Daniel 11:14] And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of
[Book of Daniel 11:15] So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and
[Book of Daniel 11:16] But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own
[Book of Daniel 11:17] He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his
[Book of Daniel 11:18] After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take
[Book of Daniel 11:19] Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but
[Book of Daniel 11:20] Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory
[Book of Daniel 11:21] And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they
[Book of Daniel 11:22] And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before
[Book of Daniel 11:23] And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully:
[Book of Daniel 11:24] He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the
[Book of Daniel 11:25] And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king
[Book of Daniel 11:26] Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy
[Book of Daniel 11:27] And both of these kings’ hearts shall be to do mischief, and
[Book of Daniel 11:28] Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his
[Book of Daniel 11:29] At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the
[Book of Daniel 11:30] For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he
[Book of Daniel 11:31] And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the
[Book of Daniel 11:32] And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by
[Book of Daniel 11:33] And they that understand among the people shall instruct many:
[Book of Daniel 11:34] Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little
[Book of Daniel 11:35] And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and
[Book of Daniel 11:36] And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt
[Book of Daniel 11:37] Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire
[Book of Daniel 11:38] But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god
[Book of Daniel 11:39] Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god,
[Book of Daniel 11:40] And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at
[Book of Daniel 11:41] He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries
[Book of Daniel 11:42] He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the
[Book of Daniel 11:43] But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of
[Book of Daniel 11:44] But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble
[Book of Daniel 11:45] And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the
[Book of Daniel 12:1] And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which
[Book of Daniel 12:2] And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake,
[Book of Daniel 12:3] And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
[Book of Daniel 12:4] But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to
[Book of Daniel 12:5] Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one
[Book of Daniel 12:6] And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the
[Book of Daniel 12:7] And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters
[Book of Daniel 12:8] And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what
[Book of Daniel 12:10] Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the
[Book of Daniel 12:11] And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away,
[Book of Daniel 12:12] Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three
[Book of Daniel 12:13] But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest,
[Book of Daniel 1:1] The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in
[Book of Daniel 1:2] The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said
[Book of Daniel 1:3] So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which
[Book of Daniel 1:4] And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a
[Book of Daniel 1:5] And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow
[Book of Daniel 1:6] And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto
[Book of Daniel 1:7] But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them
[Book of Daniel 1:8] Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.
[Book of Daniel 1:9] Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and
[Book of Daniel 1:10] Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of
[Book of Daniel 1:11] Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be
[Book of Daniel 2:1] Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.
[Book of Daniel 2:2] Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am
[Book of Daniel 2:4] And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the
[Book of Daniel 2:5] For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them
[Book of Daniel 2:6] Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a
[Book of Daniel 2:7] And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake
[Book of Daniel 2:8] For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and
[Book of Daniel 2:9] Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time
[Book of Daniel 2:10] And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,
[Book of Daniel 2:11] I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new
[Book of Daniel 2:12] And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath
[Book of Daniel 2:13] And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned
[Book of Daniel 2:14] Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the
[Book of Daniel 2:15] And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of
[Book of Daniel 2:16] And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call
[Book of Daniel 2:17] For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and
[Book of Daniel 2:18] And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts
[Book of Daniel 2:19] And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth
[Book of Daniel 2:20] I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt
[Book of Daniel 2:21] And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the
[Book of Daniel 2:23] And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy
[Book of Daniel 3:1] Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her
[Book of Daniel 3:2] So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an
[Book of Daniel 3:4] For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king,
[Book of Daniel 4:1] Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD
[Book of Daniel 4:2] By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing
[Book of Daniel 4:3] Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth
[Book of Daniel 4:4] Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as
[Book of Daniel 4:5] Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall
[Book of Daniel 4:6] My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast
[Book of Daniel 4:7] As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will
[Book of Daniel 4:8] They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on
[Book of Daniel 4:9] And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish
[Book of Daniel 4:10] For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit
[Book of Daniel 4:11] Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.
[Book of Daniel 4:12] My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth
[Book of Daniel 4:13] They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense
[Book of Daniel 4:14] I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor
[Book of Daniel 4:15] Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend;
[LORD liveth. 4:16] For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD
[LORD liveth. 4:17] Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.
[LORD liveth. 4:18] Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually:
[LORD liveth. 4:19] The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be
[LORD liveth. 5:1] Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give
[LORD liveth. 5:2] And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have
[LORD liveth. 5:3] I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim,
[LORD liveth. 5:4] They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the
[LORD liveth. 5:5] And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall
[LORD liveth. 5:6] They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the
[LORD liveth. 5:7] They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have
[LORD liveth. 5:8] Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud
[LORD liveth. 5:9] Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes
[LORD liveth. 5:10] The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound:
[LORD liveth. 5:11] Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly
[LORD liveth. 5:12] Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of
[LORD liveth. 5:13] When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went
[LORD liveth. 5:14] For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the
[LORD liveth. 5:15] I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their
[LORD liveth. 6:1] Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he
[LORD liveth. 6:2] After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise
[LORD liveth. 6:3] Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going
[LORD liveth. 6:4] O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do
[LORD liveth. 6:5] Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by
[LORD liveth. 6:6] For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God
[LORD liveth. 6:7] But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they
[LORD liveth. 6:8] Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with
[LORD liveth. 6:9] And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests
[LORD liveth. 6:10] I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is
[LORD liveth. 6:11] Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned
[LORD liveth. 7:1] When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was
[LORD liveth. 7:2] And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their
[LORD liveth. 7:3] They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes
[LORD liveth. 7:4] They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who
[LORD liveth. 7:5] In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles
[LORD liveth. 7:6] For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie
[LORD liveth. 7:7] They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all
[LORD liveth. 7:8] Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake
[LORD liveth. 7:9] Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea,
[LORD liveth. 7:10] And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not
[LORD liveth. 7:11] Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to
[LORD liveth. 7:12] When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring
[LORD liveth. 7:13] Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them!
[LORD liveth. 7:14] And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they
[LORD liveth. 7:15] Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they
[LORD liveth. 7:16] They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful
[LORD liveth. 8:1] Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against
[LORD liveth. 8:2] Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.
[LORD liveth. 8:3] Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall
[LORD liveth. 8:4] They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and
[LORD liveth. 8:5] Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled
[LORD liveth. 8:7] For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it
[LORD liveth. 8:8] Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a
[LORD liveth. 8:9] For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself:
[LORD liveth. 8:10] Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather
[LORD liveth. 8:11] Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be
[LORD liveth. 8:12] I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were
[LORD liveth. 8:13] They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and
[LORD liveth. 8:14] For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and
[LORD liveth. 9:1] Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast
[LORD liveth. 9:2] The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine
[LORD liveth. 9:3] They shall not dwell in the LORD’s land; but Ephraim shall return
[LORD liveth. 9:4] They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall
[LORD liveth. 9:5] What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of
[LORD liveth. 9:7] The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come;
[LORD liveth. 9:8] The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a
[LORD liveth. 9:9] They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah:
[LORD liveth. 9:10] I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers
[LORD liveth. 9:11] As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the
[LORD liveth. 9:12] Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them,
[LORD liveth. 9:14] Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying
[LORD liveth. 9:15] All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for
[LORD liveth. 9:16] Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no
[LORD liveth. 9:17] My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto
[LORD liveth. 10:1] Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself:
[LORD liveth. 10:2] Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall
[LORD liveth. 10:3] For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not
[LORD liveth. 10:5] The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of
[LORD liveth. 10:6] It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king
[LORD liveth. 10:7] As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.
[LORD liveth. 10:8] The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be
[LORD liveth. 10:9] O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they
[LORD liveth. 10:10] It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people
[LORD liveth. 10:11] And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread
[LORD liveth. 10:12] Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your
[LORD liveth. 10:13] Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have
[LORD liveth. 10:14] Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy
[LORD liveth. 10:15] So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in
[LORD liveth. 11:1] When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out
[LORD liveth. 11:2] As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto
[LORD liveth. 11:3] I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they
[LORD liveth. 11:4] I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to
[LORD liveth. 11:5] He shall not return into the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian
[LORD liveth. 11:6] And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his
[LORD liveth. 11:7] And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called
[LORD liveth. 11:8] How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee,
[LORD liveth. 11:9] I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not
[LORD liveth. 11:10] They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when
[LORD liveth. 11:11] They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of
[LORD liveth. 11:12] Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel
[LORD liveth. 12:1] Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he
[LORD liveth. 12:2] The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish
[LORD liveth. 12:3] He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength
[LORD liveth. 12:6] Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment and wait
[LORD liveth. 12:7] He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he
[LORD liveth. 12:8] And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out
[LORD liveth. 12:9] And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet
[LORD liveth. 12:10] I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied
[LORD liveth. 12:11] Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they
[LORD liveth. 12:12] And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for
[LORD liveth. 12:13] And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a
[LORD liveth. 12:14] Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he
[LORD liveth. 13:1] When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but
[LORD liveth. 13:2] And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images
[LORD liveth. 13:3] Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew
[LORD liveth. 13:4] Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt
[LORD liveth. 13:5] I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.
[LORD liveth. 13:6] According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were
[LORD liveth. 13:7] Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way
[LORD liveth. 13:9] O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help.
[LORD liveth. 13:10] I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in all
[LORD liveth. 13:12] The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.
[LORD liveth. 13:13] The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an
[LORD liveth. 13:14] I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem
[LORD liveth. 13:15] Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall
[LORD liveth. 13:16] Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her
[LORD liveth. 14:1] O israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by
[LORD liveth. 14:2] Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take
[LORD liveth. 14:3] Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither
[LORD liveth. 14:4] I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine
[LORD liveth. 14:5] I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and
[LORD liveth. 14:6] His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive
[LORD liveth. 14:7] They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive
[LORD liveth. 14:8] Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have
[LORD liveth. 14:9] Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and
[LORD liveth. 1:1] The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
[LORD liveth. 1:2] Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land.
[LORD liveth. 1:4] That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and
[LORD liveth. 1:5] Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine,
[LORD liveth. 1:6] For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number,
[LORD liveth. 1:7] He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made
[LORD liveth. 1:8] Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her
[LORD liveth. 1:9] The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house
[LORD liveth. 1:10] The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted:
[LORD liveth. 1:11] Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the
[LORD liveth. 1:12] The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the
[LORD liveth. 1:13] Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of
[LORD liveth. 1:14] Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and
[LORD liveth. 1:16] Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness
[LORD liveth. 1:18] How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed,
[LORD liveth. 1:19] O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the
[LORD liveth. 1:20] The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of
[LORD liveth. 2:1] Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy
[LORD liveth. 2:3] A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the
[LORD liveth. 2:4] The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as
[LORD liveth. 2:5] Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they
[LORD liveth. 2:6] Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall
[LORD liveth. 2:7] They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men
[LORD liveth. 2:9] They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the
[LORD liveth. 2:10] The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the
[LORD liveth. 2:12] Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all
[LORD liveth. 2:13] And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the
[LORD liveth. 2:14] Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing
[LORD liveth. 2:17] Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the
[LORD liveth. 2:18] Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.
[LORD liveth. 2:19] Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will
[LORD liveth. 2:21] Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great
[LORD liveth. 2:22] Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the
[LORD liveth. 2:23] Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your
[LORD liveth. 2:24] And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall
[LORD liveth. 2:25] And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten,
[LORD liveth. 2:26] And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name
[LORD liveth. 2:27] And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am
[LORD liveth. 2:28] And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my
[LORD liveth. 2:30] And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood,
[LORD liveth. 2:31] The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,
[LORD liveth. 2:32] And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name
[LORD liveth. 3:1] For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring
[LORD liveth. 3:3] And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an
[LORD liveth. 3:4] Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all
[LORD liveth. 3:7] Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold
[LORD liveth. 3:9] Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the
[LORD liveth. 3:11] Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather
[LORD liveth. 3:12] Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of
[LORD liveth. 3:13] Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you
[LORD liveth. 3:14] Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of
[LORD liveth. 3:15] The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall
[LORD liveth. 3:16] The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from
[LORD liveth. 3:17] So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my
[LORD liveth. 3:18] And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall
[LORD liveth. 3:19] Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate
[LORD liveth. 3:20] But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to
[LORD liveth. 3:21] For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the
[LORD liveth. 1:1] The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he
[LORD liveth. 1:2] And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice
[LORD liveth. 1:3] Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for
[LORD liveth. 1:5] I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant
[LORD liveth. 1:6] Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for
[LORD liveth. 1:7] But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the
[LORD liveth. 1:9] Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for
[LORD liveth. 1:11] Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for
[LORD liveth. 1:13] Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of
[LORD liveth. 2:1] Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for
[LORD liveth. 2:4] Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for
[LORD liveth. 2:6] Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for
[LORD liveth. 2:9] Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the
[LORD liveth. 2:10] Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty
[LORD liveth. 2:11] And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men
[LORD liveth. 2:12] But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the
[LORD liveth. 2:13] Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full
[LORD liveth. 2:14] Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong
[LORD liveth. 2:16] And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked
[LORD liveth. 3:1] Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children
[LORD liveth. 3:3] Can two walk together, except they be agreed? 3:4 Will a lion
[LORD liveth. 3:8] The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken,
[LORD liveth. 3:10] For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up
[LORD liveth. 3:11] Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be
[LORD liveth. 3:12] Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of
[LORD liveth. 3:13] Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD,
[LORD liveth. 3:15] And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the
[LORD liveth. 4:1] Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of
[LORD liveth. 4:2] The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall
[LORD liveth. 4:3] And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is
[LORD liveth. 4:4] Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression;
[LORD liveth. 4:6] And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,
[LORD liveth. 4:7] And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet
[LORD liveth. 4:8] So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but
[LORD liveth. 4:9] I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and
[LORD liveth. 4:10] I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt:
[LORD liveth. 4:11] I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and
[LORD liveth. 4:12] Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will
[LORD liveth. 4:13] For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind,
[God of hosts, is his name. 5:1] Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation,
[God of hosts, is his name. 5:2] The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is
[God of hosts, is his name. 5:3] For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand
[God of hosts, is his name. 5:4] For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and
[God of hosts, is his name. 5:6] Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in
[God of hosts, is his name. 5:7] Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in
[God of hosts, is his name. 5:10] They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that
[God of hosts, is his name. 5:11] Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye
[God of hosts, is his name. 5:12] For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins:
[God of hosts, is his name. 5:13] Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is
[God of hosts, is his name. 5:14] Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the
[God of hosts, is his name. 5:15] Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the

[God of hosts, is his name. 5:6] And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth
[God of hosts, is his name. 5:7] And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a
[God of hosts, is his name. 5:8] And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of
[God of hosts, is his name. 5:9] Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came
[God of hosts, is his name. 5:10] Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these

[God of hosts, is his name. 6:9] And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 6:10 Take of them
[God of hosts, is his name. 6:14] And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah,

[God of hosts, is his name. 7:12] Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should
[God of hosts, is his name. 7:13] Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:1] Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 8:2 Thus
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:3] Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:4] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:5] And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:6] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:7] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:9] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:10] For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:11] But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:12] For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit,
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:13] And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:14] For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you,
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:16] These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:18] And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying, 8:19 Thus
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:20] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:22] Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD
[God of hosts, is his name. 8:23] Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to
[God of hosts, is his name. 9:1] The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and
[God of hosts, is his name. 9:2] And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it
[God of hosts, is his name. 9:3] And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as
[God of hosts, is his name. 9:4] Behold, the LORD will cast her out, and he will smite her power in
[God of hosts, is his name. 9:5] Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be
[God of hosts, is his name. 9:6] And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride
[God of hosts, is his name. 9:7] And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his
[God of hosts, is his name. 9:8] And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of

[God of hosts, is his name. 9:15] The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and
[God of hosts, is his name. 9:16] And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock
[God of hosts, is his name. 9:17] For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn
[God of hosts, is his name. 10:1] Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the
[God of hosts, is his name. 10:2] For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a
[God of hosts, is his name. 10:3] Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the
[God of hosts, is his name. 10:4] Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him
[God of hosts, is his name. 10:5] And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies
[God of hosts, is his name. 10:6] And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the
[God of hosts, is his name. 10:7] And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart
[God of hosts, is his name. 10:8] I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them:

[God of hosts, is his name. 11:2] Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are
[God of hosts, is his name. 11:3] There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory
[God of hosts, is his name. 11:4] Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter; 11:5
[God of hosts, is his name. 11:6] For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the
[God of hosts, is his name. 11:7] And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the
[God of hosts, is his name. 11:8] Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed
[God of hosts, is his name. 11:9] Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die;
[God of hosts, is his name. 11:10] And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I
[God of hosts, is his name. 11:11] And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that
[God of hosts, is his name. 11:12] And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if
[God of hosts, is his name. 11:13] And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly
[God of hosts, is his name. 11:14] Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might
[God of hosts, is his name. 11:15] And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of
[God of hosts, is his name. 11:16] For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not
[God of hosts, is his name. 11:17] Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall
[God of hosts, is his name. 12:1] The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD,
[God of hosts, is his name. 12:2] Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the
[God of hosts, is his name. 12:3] And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all
[God of hosts, is his name. 12:4] In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with
[God of hosts, is his name. 12:5] And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The
[God of hosts, is his name. 12:6] In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of
[God of hosts, is his name. 12:7] The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory
[God of hosts, is his name. 12:8] In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
[God of hosts, is his name. 12:9] And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to
[God of hosts, is his name. 12:10] And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the
[God of hosts, is his name. 12:11] In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the
[God of hosts, is his name. 12:12] And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the
[God of hosts, is his name. 13:1] In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of
[God of hosts, is his name. 13:2] And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts,
[God of hosts, is his name. 13:3] And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then
[God of hosts, is his name. 13:4] And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be
[God of hosts, is his name. 13:6] And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands?
[God of hosts, is his name. 13:7] Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is
[God of hosts, is his name. 13:8] And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD,
[God of hosts, is his name. 13:9] And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:1] Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:2] For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:3] Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:4] And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives,
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:5] And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:6] And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:8] And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:9] And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:10] All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:11] And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:12] And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:13] And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:14] And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:15] And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:16] And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:17] And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:18] And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:19] This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:20] In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses,
[God of hosts, is his name. 14:21] Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto
[God of hosts, is his name. 1:1] The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.
[God of hosts, is his name. 1:2] I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou
[God of hosts, is his name. 1:4] Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and
[God of hosts, is his name. 1:5] And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be
[God of hosts, is his name. 1:6] A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be
[God of hosts, is his name. 1:8] And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye
[God of hosts, is his name. 1:9] And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us:
[God of hosts, is his name. 1:10] Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought?
[God of hosts, is his name. 1:11] For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the
[God of hosts, is his name. 1:12] But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is
[God of hosts, is his name. 1:13] Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed
[God of hosts, is his name. 1:14] But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and
[God of hosts, is his name. 2:1] And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.
[God of hosts, is his name. 2:2] If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give
[God of hosts, is his name. 2:3] Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces,
[God of hosts, is his name. 2:4] And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that
[God of hosts, is his name. 2:5] My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him
[God of hosts, is his name. 2:6] The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in
[God of hosts, is his name. 2:7] For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek
[God of hosts, is his name. 2:8] But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble
[God of hosts, is his name. 2:9] Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all
[God of hosts, is his name. 2:10] Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do
[God of hosts, is his name. 2:12] The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the
[God of hosts, is his name. 2:13] And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with
[God of hosts, is his name. 2:14] Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between
[God of hosts, is his name. 2:15] And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit.
[God of hosts, is his name. 2:16] For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting
[God of hosts, is his name. 2:17] Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein
[God of hosts, is his name. 3:2] But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when
[God of hosts, is his name. 3:3] And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall
[God of hosts, is his name. 3:4] Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto
[God of hosts, is his name. 3:5] And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift
[God of hosts, is his name. 3:6] For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are
[God of hosts, is his name. 3:7] Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine
[God of hosts, is his name. 3:9] Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole
[God of hosts, is his name. 3:10] Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be
[God of hosts, is his name. 3:11] And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not
[God of hosts, is his name. 3:12] And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a
[God of hosts, is his name. 3:13] Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye
[God of hosts, is his name. 3:16] Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and
[God of hosts, is his name. 3:17] And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when
[God of hosts, is his name. 3:18] Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the
[God of hosts, is his name. 4:1] For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all
[God of hosts, is his name. 4:2] But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness
[God of hosts, is his name. 4:3] And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under
[God of hosts, is his name. 4:4] Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto
[God of hosts, is his name. 4:5] Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 1:1] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 1:2] Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 1:10] And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 1:17] So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 1:18] Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 1:19] Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to

[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 1:22] Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 1:24] Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:1] Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:3] When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:4] And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:5] And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:7] Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:8] And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:9] When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:10] When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:11] And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:12] And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:13] And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:14] When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:16] Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:17] Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:19] But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:21] And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 2:22] But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 3:1] In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 3:3] For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 3:4] And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 3:5] Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 3:7] But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 3:10] And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 3:11] I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 3:13] Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 3:14] But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 3:16] And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the

[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 4:5] Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 4:7] Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the

[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 4:9] And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 4:10] Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 4:11] Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 4:12] Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 4:17] From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 4:18] And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 4:19] And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 4:20] And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 4:21] And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 4:22] And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 4:23] And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 4:24] And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 4:25] And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:1] And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:4] Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:5] Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:6] Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness:
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:7] Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:8] Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:9] Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:10] Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake:
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:11] Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:12] Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:13] Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:14] Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:15] Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:16] Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:17] Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:18] For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:19] Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:20] For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:21] Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:22] But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:23] Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:25] Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:26] Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:27] Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:29] And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:30] And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:31] It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:33] Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:36] Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:37] But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:38] Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:40] And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:41] And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:42] Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:43] Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:44] But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 5:46] For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:1] Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them:
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:2] Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:3] But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:5] And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are:
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:6] But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:7] But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:8] Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:9] After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:10] Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:11] Give us this day our daily bread.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:12] And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:13] And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:14] For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:16] Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:17] But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:19] Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:22] The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:23] But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:25] Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:30] Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:33] But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 6:34] Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:1] Judge not, that ye be not judged.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:2] For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:3] And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:6] Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:7] Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:9] Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:13] Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:15] Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:16] Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:18] A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:19] Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:20] Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:21] Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:22] Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:24] Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:26] And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 7:28] And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:1] When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:2] And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:3] And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:4] And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:5] And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:7] And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:8] The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:9] For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:10] When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:11] And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:12] But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:13] And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:14] And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:15] And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:16] When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:18] Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:19] And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:20] And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:21] And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:22] But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:23] And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:24] And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:25] And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:26] And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:27] But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:29] And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:31] So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:32] And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:33] And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 8:34] And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:1] And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:2] And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:3] And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:4] And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:7] And he arose, and departed to his house.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:8] But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:9] And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:10] And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:11] And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:13] But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:14] Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:16] No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:17] Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:18] While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:19] And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:20] And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:21] For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:22] But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:23] And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:25] But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:26] And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:27] And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:28] And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him:
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:29] Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:30] And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:31] But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:32] As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:33] And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:34] But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:35] And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:36] But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 9:37] Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:1] And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:2] Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:5] These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:7] And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:8] Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:9] Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, 10:10
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:11] And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:12] And when ye come into an house, salute it.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:13] And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:14] And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:15] Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:16] Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:17] But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:19] But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:20] For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:21] And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the

[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:24] The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:25] It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:27] What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:28] And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:29] Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall

[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:31] Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:32] Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:33] But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:34] Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:35] For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:36] And a man’s foes shall be they of his own household.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:37] He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:38] And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:39] He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:40] He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:41] He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 10:42] And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:1] And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:2] Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:6] And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:7] And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:9] But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:10] For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:11] Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:12] And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:13] For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:14] And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:15] He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:16] But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:18] For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:19] The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:20] Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:22] But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:23] And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:24] But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:25] At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:26] Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:27] All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:28] Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:29] Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 11:30] For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:1] At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:2] But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:3] But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:6] But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:7] But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:8] For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:9] And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:10] And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:11] And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:13] Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:14] Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:15] But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:19] He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:20] A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:21] And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:22] Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:23] And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:25] And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:28] But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:29] Or else how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:30] He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:31] Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:32] And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:33] Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:34] O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:35] A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:36] But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:37] For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:38] Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:39] But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:41] The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:42] The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:43] When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:44] Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:45] Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:46] While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:47] Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:48] But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 12:50] For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:1] The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:2] And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:3] And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:7] And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:9] Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:10] And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:12] For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:13] Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:14] And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:16] But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:17] For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:18] Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:19] When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:20] But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:22] He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:23] But he that received seed into the good ground is he that
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:24] Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:26] But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:27] So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:30] Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:31] Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:33] Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:34] All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:36] Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:37] He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:40] As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:41] The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:43] Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:44] Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:45] Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:47] Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:49] So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:51] Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:52] Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:53] And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:54] And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:57] And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 13:58] And he did not many mighty works there because of their
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:1] At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, 14:2
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:3] For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:4] For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:5] And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:6] But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:7] Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:8] And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:9] And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath’s sake, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:10] And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:11] And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel:
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:12] And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:13] When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:14] And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:15] And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:16] But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:17] And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:18] He said, Bring them hither to me.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:19] And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:20] And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:21] And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:22] And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:23] And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:24] But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves:
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:25] And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:26] And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:27] But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer;
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:28] And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:29] And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:30] But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:31] And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:32] And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:33] Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:34] And when they were gone over, they came into the land of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 14:35] And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:1] Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:3] But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:5] But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:7] Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, 15:8 This
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:9] But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:10] And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:12] Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:14] Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:15] Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:16] And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? 15:17 Do
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:19] For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:21] Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:22] And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:23] But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:24] But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:25] Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:26] But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:27] And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:28] Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:29] And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:30] And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:32] Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:33] And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:35] And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:36] And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:37] And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:38] And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 15:39] And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:1] The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:2] He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:3] And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:5] And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:6] Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:7] And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:8] Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:13] When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:14] And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:15] He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? 16:16 And Simon
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:17] And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:18] And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:19] And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:20] Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:21] From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:22] Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:23] But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:24] Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:25] For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:26] For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 16:28] Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:1] And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:3] And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:4] Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:5] While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:6] And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:7] And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:8] And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:9] And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:10] And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:12] But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:13] Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:14] And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:16] And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:17] Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:18] And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:19] Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:21] Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:22] And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:24] And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:25] He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 17:27] Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:1] At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:4] Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:5] And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:6] But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:7] Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:9] And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:10] Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:11] For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:12] How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:14] Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:15] Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:16] But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:17] And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church:
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:18] Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:19] Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:20] For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:21] Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:23] Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:24] And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:25] But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:26] The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:27] Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:28] But the same servant went out, and found one of his
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:29] And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:30] And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:31] So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:32] Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 18:35] So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:1] And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:3] The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:4] And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:7] They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:9] And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:10] His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:11] But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:12] For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:13] Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:14] But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:15] And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:16] And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:18] He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:20] The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:22] But when the young man heard that saying, he went away
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:23] Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:24] And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:25] When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:27] Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:29] And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 19:30] But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:1] For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:2] And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:3] And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:5] Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:6] And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:8] So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:9] And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:10] But when the first came, they supposed that they should have
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:11] And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:13] But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:15] Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:17] And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:20] Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children with her sons,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:21] And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:22] But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:23] And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:24] And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:25] But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:26] But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:29] And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:30] And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:31] And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:32] And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 20:34] So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:1] And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:2] Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:3] And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:4] All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:6] And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them, 21:7 And
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:8] And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way;
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:9] And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:10] And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:12] And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:14] And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:15] And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:18] Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:19] And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:20] And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:22] And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:23] And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:25] The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:27] And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:28] But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:29] He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:30] And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:31] Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:32] For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:33] Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:35] And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:36] Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:37] But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:38] But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:39] And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:40] When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:42] Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:43] Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:44] And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:45] And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 21:46] But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:1] And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:4] Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:5] But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:7] But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:8] Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:9] Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:10] So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:11] And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:13] Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:14] For many are called, but few are chosen.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:15] Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:16] And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:17] Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:20] And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:21] They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:22] When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:23] The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:25] Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:27] And last of all the woman died also.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:28] Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:29] Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:30] For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:31] But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:33] And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:34] But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:35] Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:38] This is the first and great commandment.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:39] And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:40] On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:41] While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:42] Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 22:43] He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:1] Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, 23:2
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:4] For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:5] But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:6] And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:8] But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ;
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:9] And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:10] Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:11] But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:12] And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:13] But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:14] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:15] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:16] Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:19] Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:21] And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:22] And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:23] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:24] Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:25] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:26] Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:27] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:28] Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:29] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:31] Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:32] Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:33] Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:36] Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:37] O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 23:39] For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:1] And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:2] And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:3] And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:5] For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:6] And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:7] For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:8] All these are the beginning of sorrows.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:9] Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:10] And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:11] And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:12] And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:13] But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:14] And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:15] When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:19] And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:22] And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:23] Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:24] For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:25] Behold, I have told you before.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:26] Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:27] For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:28] For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:29] Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:31] And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:32] Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:34] Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:35] Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:36] But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:37] But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:38] For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:40] Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:41] Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:42] Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:43] But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:44] Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:45] Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:47] Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 24:48] But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:1] Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:2] And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:3] They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:5] While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:6] And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:7] Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:8] And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:9] But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:10] And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:11] Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:12] But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:13] Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:14] For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:15] And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:16] Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:17] And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:18] But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:19] After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:20] And so he that had received five talents came and brought other
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:21] His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:22] He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:23] His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant;
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:24] Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:26] His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:28] Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:29] For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:30] And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:31] When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:34] Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:37] Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:41] Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:44] Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 25:46] And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:1] And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:3] Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:5] But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:6] Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:7] There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:8] But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:10] When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:11] For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:12] For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:13] Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:14] Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:16] And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:17] Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:19] And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:20] Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:21] And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:22] And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:24] The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:25] Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:26] And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:27] And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:29] But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:30] And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:31] Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:32] But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:33] Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:34] Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:35] Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:36] Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:37] And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:38] Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:39] And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:40] And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:42] He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:43] And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:44] And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:45] Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:46] Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:47] And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:48] Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:49] And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:50] And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:51] And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:52] Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place:
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:53] Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:56] But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:57] And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:58] But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:59] Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:62] And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:64] Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:65] Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:66] What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:67] Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:70] But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:71] And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:72] And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:73] And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:74] Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 26:75] And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:1] When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:3] Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:5] And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:6] And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:7] And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:8] Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:9] Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:11] And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:12] And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:13] Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:15] Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:16] And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:17] Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:19] When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:20] But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:21] The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:22] Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:23] And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:24] When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:25] Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:26] Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:27] Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:28] And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:29] And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:31] And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:32] And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name:
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:33] And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:35] And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots:
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:36] And sitting down they watched him there; 27:37 And set up over
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:38] Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:39] And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, 27:40
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:41] Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:43] He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him:
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:44] The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:45] Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:46] And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:48] And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:49] The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:50] Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:51] And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:54] Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:55] And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:57] When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:59] And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:61] And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over
[Gospel According to Saint Matthew 27:62] Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 1:12] And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 1:13] And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan;

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 1:40] And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 1:41] And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 1:42] And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 1:43] And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 1:44
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 1:45] But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 2:16] And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 2:18] And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 2:20] But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 2:21] No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 3:2] And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 3:3] And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 3:12] And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 3:13] And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 3:14] And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 3:22] And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 3:23] And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 3:25] And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 3:27] No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 3:28] Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 3:30] Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 3:31] There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 3:32] And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 3:33] And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 3:34] And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:1] And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:2] And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:10] And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:11] And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:13] And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:15] And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:16] And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:17] And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time:
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:18] And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:24] And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:25] For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:26] And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:28] For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:29] But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:30] And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:33] And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:34] But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:35] And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:38] And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow:
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 4:40] And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:2] And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:5] And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:6] But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, 5:7 And
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:8] For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:9] And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:11] Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:12] And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:13] And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:14] And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:15] And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:18] And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:19] Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:20] And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:22] And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:24] And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:25] And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:26] And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:27] When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:28] For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:29] And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:30] And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:33] But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:34] And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole;
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:35] While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:38] And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:39] And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:40] And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:41] And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 5:42] And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:1] And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:2] And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:4] But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:5] And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:6] And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:7] And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:10] And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:11] And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:12] And they went out, and preached that men should repent.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:13] And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:25] And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:26] And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath’s sake, and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:27] And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:29] And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:30] And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:31] And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:32] And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:33] And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:34] And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:35] And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:37] He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:39] And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:40] And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:41] And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:42] And they did all eat, and were filled.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:43] And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:51] And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:52] For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:53] And when they had passed over, they came into the land of
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:54] And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 6:56] And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:1] Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:3] For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:4] And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:5] Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:7] Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:8] For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:9] And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:10] For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:12] And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:14] And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:16] If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:17] And when he was entered into the house from the people, his
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:18] And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:21] For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:24] And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:25] For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:27] But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:28] And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:30] And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:31] And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:32] And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:33] And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 7:35] And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:10] And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:11] And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:12] And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:13] And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:14] Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:15] And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:16] And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:20] And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:21] And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand? 8:22
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:23] And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:24] And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:25] After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:26] And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:27] And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:29] And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:30] And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:31] And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:32] And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:33] But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:34] And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:35] For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 8:36] For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:1] And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:5] And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:6] For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:7] And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:8] And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:9] And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:10] And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:16] And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them? 9:17 And
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:19] He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:20] And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:21] And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:22] And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters,

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:24] And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:25] When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:26] And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:27] But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:28] And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:30] And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:31] For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:32] But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:33] And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:35] And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:36] And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:38] And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:39] But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:40] For he that is not against us is on our part.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:41] For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:42] And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 9:43] And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:3] And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:4] And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:5] And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:6] But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:7] For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:9] What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:10] And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:11] And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:12] And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:13] And they brought young children to him, that he should touch
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:14] But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:15] Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:16] And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:17] And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:19] Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:21] Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:22] And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:23] And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:24] And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:26] And they were astonished out of measure, saying among
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:28] Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:29] And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:30] But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:31] But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:32] And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:35] And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:36] And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:37] They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:38] But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:41] And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:42] But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:43] But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:45] For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:46] And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:47] And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:48] And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:49] And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:50] And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:51] And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 10:52] And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:1] And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:3] And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:4] And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:5] And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:7] And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:8] And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:9] And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:11] And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:12] And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:15] And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:17] And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:18] And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:19] And when even was come, he went out of the city.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:20] And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:21] And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:22] And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:23] For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:24] Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:25] And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:26] But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:30] The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:31] And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 11:33] And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:1] And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:2] And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:3] And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:4] And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:5] And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others;
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:6] Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:7] But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir;
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:8] And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:9] What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:10] And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:13] And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:14] And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:16] And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:17] And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:18] Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:20] Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:21] And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:22] And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:23] In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:24] And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:26] And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:28] And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:31] And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:32] And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:34] And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:35] And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:37] David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:38] And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:41] And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:42] And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 12:43] And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:1] And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:2] And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:3] And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:7] And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:8] For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:9] But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:10] And the gospel must first be published among all nations.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:11] But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:12] Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:13] And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:14] But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:16] And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:17] But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:19] For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:20] And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:21] And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:23] But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:24] But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:26] And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:27] And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:28] Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:30] Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:31] Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:32] But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:33] Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:34] For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:35] Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 13:37] And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:1] After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:4] And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:6] And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:7] For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:8] She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:9] Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:10] And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:11] And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:12] And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:14] And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:16] And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:17] And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:18] And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:19] And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:21] The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:22] And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:23] And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:24] And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:25] Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:26] And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:27] And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:28] But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:29] But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:30] And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:31] But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:32] And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:33] And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:35] And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:36] And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee;
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:37] And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:39] And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:40] And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:41] And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:42] Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:43] And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:44] And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:45] And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:46] And they laid their hands on him, and took him.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:47] And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:48] And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:50] And they all forsook him, and fled.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:51] And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:53] And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:54] And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:55] And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:56] For many bare false witness against him, but their witness
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:57] And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:59] But neither so did their witness agree together.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:60] And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:63] Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:65] And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:66] And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:68] But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:69] And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:70] And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:71] But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 14:72] And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:1] And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:2] And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:3] And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:4] And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:5] But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:6] Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:7] And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:8] And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:9] But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:11] But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:12] And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:14] Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:15] And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:16] And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium;
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:17] And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:20] And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:21] And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:22] And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:28] And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:29] And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:31] Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:32] Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:33] And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the

[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:40] There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:42] And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation,
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:44] And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto
[Gospel According to Saint Mark 15:45] And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to

[Gospel According to Saint Luke 1:36] And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 1:37] For with God nothing shall be impossible.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 1:38] And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 1:39] And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with

[Gospel According to Saint Luke 1:48] For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 1:49] For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 1:50] And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to

[Gospel According to Saint Luke 1:54] He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 1:55] As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 1:56] And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 1:57] Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and

[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:7] If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:8] And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan:
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:9] And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the

[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:15] And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:16] And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:17] And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:20] And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:21] And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:22] And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:24] And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:25] But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:27] And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:28] And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were

[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:37] And the fame of him went out into every place of the country
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:38] And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:39] And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her:

[Gospel According to Saint Luke 4:44] And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:1] And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:3] And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:4] Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:5] And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the

[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:8] When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:9] For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:11] And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:12] And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:13] And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:14] And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to

[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:17] And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:18] And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:19] And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:20] And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:21] And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:22] But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:25] And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:26] And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:27] And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:28] And he left all, rose up, and followed him.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:29] And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:30] But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:32] I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:33] And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:35] But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:36] And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:37] And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:38] But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 5:39] No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:1] And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:2] And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:6] And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:7] And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:8] But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:9] Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:11] And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:12] And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:13] And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:17] And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:19] And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:20] And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:21] Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:22] Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:23] Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:24] But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:25] Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:26] Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:27] But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:29] And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:30] Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:31] And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:32] For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:33] And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:34] And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:35] But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:36] Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:37] Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:39] And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind?
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:41] And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:43] For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:44] For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:45] A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:46] And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 6:49] But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:1] Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:2] And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:3] And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:4] And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:6] Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:8] For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:9] When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:10] And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:11] And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:12] Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:13] And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:14] And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:15] And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:16] And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:17] And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:18] And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:19] And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:20] When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:22] Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:23] And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:24] And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:26] But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:27] This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:28] For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:29] And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:30] But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:31] And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:33] For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine;
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:34] The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:35] But wisdom is justified of all her children.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:36] And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:37] And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:39] Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:40] And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:41] There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:42] And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:44] And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:45] Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:46] My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:47] Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:48] And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 7:49] And they that sat at meat with him began to say within
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:1] And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:4] And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:6] And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:7] And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:8] And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:9] And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:10] And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:11] Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:12] Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:13] They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the

[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:15] But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:16] No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:17] For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither

[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:26] And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:27] And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:28] When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:29] (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:31] And they besought him that he would not command them to go out
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:32] And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:33] Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine:
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:34] When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:35] Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:36] They also which saw it told them by what means he that was
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:37] Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:38] Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:40] And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:41] And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:43] And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had

[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:45] And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:47] And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:48] And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:49] While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:50] But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not:
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:51] And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:52] And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not

[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:54] And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:55] And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 8:56] And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:1] Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:2] And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:3] And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:4] And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:5] And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:6] And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:7] Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:9] And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:10] And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:11] And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:12] And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:13] But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:14] For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:15] And they did so, and made them all sit down.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:16] Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:17] And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:18] And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:19] They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:20] He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:21] And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:23] And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:24] For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:25] For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:27] But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:28] And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:29] And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:30] And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:32] But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:33] And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:34] While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them:
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:35] And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:36] And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:37] And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:38] And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:39] And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:40] And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:41] And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:42] And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:43] And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:45] But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:46] Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:47] And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:49] And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:50] And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:51] And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:53] And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:54] And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:56] For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:57] And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:58] And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:59] And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:60] Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:61] And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 9:62] And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:1] After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:2] Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:3] Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:4] Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:5] And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:6] And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it:
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:7] And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:8] And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:10] But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:12] But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:13] Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:14] But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:15] And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:16] He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:17] And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:18] And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:19] Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:20] Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:21] In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:22] All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:23] And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:25] And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:28] And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:29] But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:31] And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:32] And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:33] But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:35] And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:36] Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:38] Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:39] And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus’ feet,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:40] But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 10:41] And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:1] And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:2] And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:3] Give us day by day our daily bread.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:4] And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:5] And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:8] I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:9] And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:10] For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:11] If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:15] But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:16] And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:17] But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:18] If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:19] And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:20] But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:21] When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:23] He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:24] When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:25] And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:26] Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:27] And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:28] But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:29] And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:30] For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:31] The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:32] The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:33] No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:34] The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:35] Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:36] If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:37] And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:38] And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:39] And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:40] Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:42] But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:43] Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:44] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:45] Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:46] And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:47] Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:48] Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers:
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:49] Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:52] Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 11:53] And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:1] In the mean time, when there were gathered together an
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:2] For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:3] Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:4] And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:5] But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:6] Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:8] Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:10] And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:11] And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:13] And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:14] And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:16] And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:19] And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:20] But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:22] And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:23] The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:24] Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:28] If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:30] For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:31] But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:32] Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:33] Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:34] For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:35] Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; 12:36
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:37] Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:38] And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:39] And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:40] Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:41] Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:44] Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:45] But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:47] And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:48] But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:49] I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:52] For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:53] The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:54] And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:55] And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat;
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:56] Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 12:59] I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:1] There were present at that season some that told him of the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:2] And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:4] Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:6] He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:7] Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:10] And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:11] And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:12] And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:13] And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:14] And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:15] The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:18] Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:20] And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:21] It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:22] And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:23] Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:25] When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:27] But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are;
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:28] There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:29] And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:30] And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:31] The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:32] And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:33] Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 13:34] O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:1] And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:2] And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:3] And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:6] And they could not answer him again to these things.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:7] And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:8] When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:9] And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:10] But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room;
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:11] For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:12] Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:13] But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:15] And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:16] Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:18] And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:19] And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:20] And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:21] So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:22] And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:23] And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:24] For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:25] And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:27] And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:28] For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:29] Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:31] Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:33] So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 14:34] Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:1] Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:2] And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:3] And he spake this parable unto them, saying, 15:4 What man of
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:6] And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:7] I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:8] Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:10] Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:11] And he said, A certain man had two sons: 15:12 And the younger
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:13] And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:14] And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:15] And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:16] And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:17] And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:18] I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:20] And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:21] And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:22] But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:23] And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:25] Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:26] And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:27] And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:28] And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:29] And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:31] And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 15:32] It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:1] And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:2] And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:3] Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:4] I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:5] So he called every one of his lord’s debtors unto him, and said
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:7] Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:8] And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:9] And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:10] He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:11] If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:14] And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:15] And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:16] The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:17] And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:18] Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:19] There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:22] And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:24] And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:25] But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:26] And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:27] Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:29] Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:30] And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 16:31] And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:1] Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:3] Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:4] And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:5] And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:6] And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:7] But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:10] So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:11] And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:12] And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:14] And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:15] And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:17] And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:19] And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:20] And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:22] And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:23] And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:24] For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:25] But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:26] And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:27] They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:28] Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:30] Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:31] In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:32] Remember Lot’s wife.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:33] Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:34] I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:35] Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:36] Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 17:37] And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:1] And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:4] And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:6] And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:7] And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:11] The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:12] I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:13] And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:14] I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:15] And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:16] But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:17] Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:18] And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:20] Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:21] And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:22] Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:23] And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:24] And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:25] For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:26] And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved? 18:27 And
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:28] Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:29] And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:31] Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:32] For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:34] And they understood none of these things: and this saying was
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:35] And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:37] And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:38] And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:39] And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:40] And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:42] And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 18:43] And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:1] And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:2] And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:3] And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:4] And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:5] And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:6] And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:7] And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:8] And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:9] And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:10] For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:11] And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:12] He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:13] And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:14] But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:15] And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:16] Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:17] And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:18] And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:19] And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:20] And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:22] And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:25] (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) 19:26 For I
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:27] But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:28] And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:29] And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:31] And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:32] And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:33] And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:35] And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:36] And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:37] And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:39] And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:40] And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:41] And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:42] Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:43] For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:45] And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 19:47] And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:1] And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:7] And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:8] And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:9] Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:10] And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:11] And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:12] And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:13] Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:14] But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:15] So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:17] And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:19] And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:20] And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:21] And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:25] And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:26] And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:27] Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:29] There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:30] And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:31] And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:32] Last of all the woman died also.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:33] Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:34] And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:37] Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:38] For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:39] Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:40] And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:41] And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David’s son?
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:42] And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:44] David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son? 20:45
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 20:46] Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:1] And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:2] And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:3] And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:5] And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:7] And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:8] And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:9] But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified:
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:10] Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:12] But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:13] And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:14] Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:16] And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:17] And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:18] But there shall not an hair of your head perish.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:19] In your patience possess ye your souls.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:20] And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:21] Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:22] For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:23] But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:24] And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:25] And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:27] And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:28] And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:29] And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:31] So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:32] Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:33] Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:34] And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:35] For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:36] Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:37] And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 21:38] And all the people came early in the morning to him in the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:1] Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:2] And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him;
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:3] Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:4] And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:5] And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:6] And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:7] Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:8] And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:9] And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? 22:10
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:11] And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:13] And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:14] And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:15] And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:17] And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:19] And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:20] Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:21] But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:22] And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:24] And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:25] And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:26] But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:27] For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:28] Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:29] And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:31] And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:33] And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:34] And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:35] And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:36] Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:37] For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:38] And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:39] And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:40] And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:41] And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:43] And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:44] And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:45] And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:47] And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:48] But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:50] And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:51] And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:52] Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:54] Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:55] And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:56] But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:57] And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:58] And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:59] And about the space of one hour after another confidently
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:60] And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:61] And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:62] And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:63] And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:64] And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:66] And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:69] Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:70] Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 22:71] And they said, What need we any further witness? for we
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:1] And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:2] And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:3] And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:4] Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:5] And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:6] When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:7] And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:8] And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:9] Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:10] And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:11] And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:12] And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together:
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:13] And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:16] I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:17] (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:18] And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:21] But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:22] And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:23] And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:24] And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:25] And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:26] And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:27] And there followed him a great company of people, and of women,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:28] But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:29] For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:30] Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:31] For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:33] And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:34] Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:35] And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:36] And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:38] And a superscription also was written over him in letters of
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:39] And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:40] But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:42] And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:43] And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:44] And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:45] And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:46] And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:47] Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:48] And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:49] And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:50] And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:52] This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:53] And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:54] And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:55] And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 23:56] And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:1] Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:2] And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:3] And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:4] And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:7] Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:8] And they remembered his words, 24:9 And returned from the
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:10] It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:11] And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:12] Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:13] And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:14] And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:15] And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:16] But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:17] And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:20] And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:21] But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:22] Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:24] And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:25] Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:28] And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:29] But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:30] And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:31] And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:32] And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us,
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:35] And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:36] And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:37] But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:38] And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:40] And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:41] And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:43] And he took it, and did eat before them.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:44] And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:45] Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:47] And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:48] And ye are witnesses of these things.
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:49] And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:50] And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:51] And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from
[Gospel According to Saint Luke 24:52] And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:1] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:2] The same was in the beginning with God.
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:3] All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:4] In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:5] And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:6] There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:7] The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:8] He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:9] That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:10] He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:11] He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:12] But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:14] And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:15] John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:16] And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:17] For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:18] No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:19] And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:21] And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:22] Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:24] And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:25] And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then,
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:28] These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:29] The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:30] This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:31] And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:32] And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:33] And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water,
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:34] And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:35] Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:36] And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:38] Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them,
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:40] One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:41] He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:42] And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said,
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:43] The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:44] Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:45] Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him,
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:46] And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:47] Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:49] Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:50] Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw
[Gospel According to Saint John 1:51] And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:1] And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:3] And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:4] Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:5] His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you,
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:6] And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:7] Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:8] And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:9] When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:11] This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:12] After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:13] And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:14] And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves,
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:17] And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:18] Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:20] Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:22] When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:23] Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day,
[Gospel According to Saint John 2:24] But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:1] There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:3] Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:4] Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old?
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:6] That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:7] Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:8] The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:9] Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:10] Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel,
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:12] If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:14] And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:16] For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:17] For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:18] He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:19] And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:20] For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:21] But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:22] After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:23] And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:24] For John was not yet cast into prison.
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:25] Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:26] And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:27] John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:28] Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ,
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:29] He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:30] He must increase, but I must decrease.
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:31] He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:32] And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:33] He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:34] For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:35] The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his
[Gospel According to Saint John 3:36] He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:1] When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:4] And he must needs go through Samaria.
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:5] Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:6] Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:7] There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:8] (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) 4:9
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:10] Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:11] The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:12] Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well,
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:15] The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:16] Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:17] The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:19] The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:20] Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:21] Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:22] Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:23] But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:24] God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:25] The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:26] Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:27] And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:31] In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:32] But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:33] Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:35] Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:36] And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:37] And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:38] I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:39] And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:40] So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:41] And many more believed because of his own word; 4:42 And said
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:43] Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:44] For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:45] Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him,
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:46] So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:47] When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:48] Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:49] The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:50] Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:51] And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him,
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:52] Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:53] So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which
[Gospel According to Saint John 4:54] This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:1] After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:2] Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:3] In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt,
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:4] For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:5] And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:6] When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:8] Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:9] And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:10] The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:11] He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me,
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:12] Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:14] Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:15] The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:16] And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:17] But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:18] Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:19] Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:20] For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:21] For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:22] For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:24] Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:25] Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is,
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:26] For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:28] Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:30] I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:31] If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:32] There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:33] Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:34] But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say,
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:35] He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:36] But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:37] And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:38] And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent,
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:39] Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life:
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:40] And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:41] I receive not honour from men.
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:42] But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:43] I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:44] How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:46] For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he
[Gospel According to Saint John 5:47] But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:2] And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:3] And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:4] And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:5] When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:7] Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:8] One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:11] And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:12] When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:13] Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:14] Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did,
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:15] When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:16] And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:17] And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:18] And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:19] So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs,
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:20] But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:21] Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:22] The day following, when the people which stood on the other side
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:23] (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:25] And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:27] Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:28] Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:30] They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:32] Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:33] For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:34] Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:35] And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:36] But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:37] All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:38] For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:39] And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:40] And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:41] The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:42] And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:44] No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:45] It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:46] Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God,
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:47] Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:48] I am that bread of life.
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:49] Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:50] This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:51] I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:52] The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:54] Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life;
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:55] For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:56] He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me,
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:57] As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:58] This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:59] These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:60] Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said,
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:64] But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:65] And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:66] From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:67] Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? 6:68 Then
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:69] And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of
[Gospel According to Saint John 6:70] Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:1] After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:2] Now the Jew’s feast of tabernacles was at hand.
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:3] His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:4] For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:5] For neither did his brethren believe in him.
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:6] Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:7] The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:8] Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:9] When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:10] But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:11] Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:12] And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:13] Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:14] Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple,
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:15] And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters,
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:17] If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:18] He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:19] Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:22] Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:23] If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:25] Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:27] Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:28] Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:29] But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:30] Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him,
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:31] And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:32] The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:33] Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:34] Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:35] Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:38] He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:39] (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:41] Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:44] And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:45] Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:47] Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? 7:48
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:50] Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being
[Gospel According to Saint John 7:53] And every man went unto his own house.
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:1] Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:2] And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:3] And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:5] Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:7] So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:8] And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:9] And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience,
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:10] When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:12] Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:13] The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:14] Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:15] Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:16] And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:17] It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:18] I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:19] Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:20] These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:21] Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:22] Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith,
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:23] And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:24] I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:25] Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them,
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:26] I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:27] They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:28] Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man,
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:29] And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:30] As he spake these words, many believed on him.
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:31] Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:33] They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:35] And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:36] If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:37] I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me,
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:38] I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:39] They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:40] But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth,
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:41] Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:42] Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me:
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:43] Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:44] Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:45] And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:46] Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:48] Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:50] And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:51] Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:52] Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:53] Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:56] Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:57] Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old,
[Gospel According to Saint John 8:59] Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself,
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:1] And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:2] And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:4] I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:5] As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:6] When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:7] And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:8] The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:10] Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? 9:11
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:12] Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:13] They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:14] And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:15] Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:16] Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God,
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:17] They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:18] But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:19] And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:21] But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:22] These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:23] Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:24] Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him,
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:25] He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not:
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:26] Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:29] We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:30] The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:31] Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:32] Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:33] If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:34] They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:35] Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:38] And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:39] And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they
[Gospel According to Saint John 9:40] And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words,
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:1] Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:2] But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:3] To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:4] And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them,
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:5] And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:6] This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:7] Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:8] All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:9] I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:10] The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:11] I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:12] But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:13] The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:14] I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:15] As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:16] And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:17] Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:18] No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:19] There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:20] And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:23] And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:24] Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:25] Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:26] But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:27] My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:28] And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:29] My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:30] I and my Father are one.
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:31] Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:32] Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:34] Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:38] But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:39] Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:41] And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but
[Gospel According to Saint John 10:42] And many believed on him there.
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:1] Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:2] (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:4] When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death,
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:5] Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:6] When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:7] Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:8] His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:10] But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:11] These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:12] Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:13] Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:14] Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:15] And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:16] Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellow
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:17] Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:18] Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:19] And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:20] Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:21] Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:22] But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:23] Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:24] Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:25] Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:28] And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:29] As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:30] Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:31] The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:32] Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:33] When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:34] And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:35] Jesus wept.
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:36] Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! 11:37 And some of
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:39] Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:40] Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:42] And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:43] And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:44] And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:45] Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:46] But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:47] Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:48] If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:49] And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:51] And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:53] Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:54] Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:55] And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of
[Gospel According to Saint John 11:56] Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:1] Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:2] There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:3] Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:4] Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son,
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:7] Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:8] For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:9] Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:10] But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:12] On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:14] And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:16] These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:17] The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:18] For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:19] The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:20] And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:22] Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:23] And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:24] Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:25] He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:26] If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:27] Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:28] Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:29] The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:30] Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:31] Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:32] And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:33] This he said, signifying what death he should die.
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:34] The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:36] While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:37] But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:41] These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:42] Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him;
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:44] Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:45] And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:46] I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:47] And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not:
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:48] He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:49] For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me,
[Gospel According to Saint John 12:50] And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:1] Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:2] And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:5] After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:6] Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord,
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:8] Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:9] Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:10] Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:11] For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:12] So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments,
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:14] If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:15] For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:16] Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:17] If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:18] I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:19] Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:20] Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:21] When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:22] Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:23] Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:24] Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:25] He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:26] Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:27] And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:28] Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:29] For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:30] He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:31] Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:32] If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:33] Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:34] A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:35] By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:36] Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:37] Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will
[Gospel According to Saint John 13:38] Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:1] Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:2] In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:3] And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:4] And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:5] Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:7] If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:8] Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:9] Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:11] Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:12] Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:13] And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:14] If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:15] If ye love me, keep my commandments.
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:16] And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:18] I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:19] Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:20] At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me,
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:21] He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:22] Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:24] He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:25] These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:26] But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:27] Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:28] Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:29] And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:30] Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this
[Gospel According to Saint John 14:31] But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:1] I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:2] Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:3] Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:4] Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:5] I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:6] If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:7] If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:8] Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:9] As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:10] If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:11] These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:12] This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:13] Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:14] Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:15] Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:16] Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you,
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:17] These things I command you, that ye love one another.
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:18] If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:19] If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:20] Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:21] But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake,
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:22] If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin:
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:23] He that hateth me hateth my Father also.
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:24] If I had not done among them the works which none other man did,
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:25] But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that
[Gospel According to Saint John 15:26] But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:1] These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:2] They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh,
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:3] And these things will they do unto you, because they have not
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:4] But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come,
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:5] But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:7] Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:8] And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:12] I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:13] Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:14] He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:15] All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:16] A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:17] Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:19] Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:21] A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:22] And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:23] And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:24] Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:25] These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:26] At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you,
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:28] I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again,
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:29] His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:30] Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:31] Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? 16:32 Behold, the hour
[Gospel According to Saint John 16:33] These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:1] These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:3] And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:4] I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:5] And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:6] I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:7] Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:8] For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:9] I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:10] And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:11] And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world,
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:12] While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name:
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:13] And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world,
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:14] I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them,
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:15] I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:16] They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:17] Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:18] As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:19] And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:20] Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:22] And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:24] Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:25] O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have
[Gospel According to Saint John 17:26] And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it:
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:1] When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:2] And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:3] Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:4] Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him,
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:6] As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:7] Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:8] Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:10] Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:11] Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath:
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:14] Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:15] And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple:
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:16] But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:17] Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:18] And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:19] The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:20] Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:21] Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:22] And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:25] And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:26] One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:27] Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:28] Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:29] Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:31] Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:33] Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:36] Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:37] Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:38] Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this,
[Gospel According to Saint John 18:39] But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the
[Gospel According to Saint John 19:1] Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
[Gospel According to Saint John 19:2] And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his
[Gospel According to Saint John 19:4] Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I
[Gospel According to Saint John 19:5] Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the
[Gospel According to Saint John 19:7] The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to
[Gospel According to Saint John 19:8] When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;
[Gospel According to Saint John 19:9] And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus,
[Gospel According to Saint John 19:10] Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest
[Gospel According to Saint John 19:12] And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews
[Gospel According to Saint John 19:13] When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth,
[Gospel According to Saint John 19:14] And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth
[Gospel According to Saint John 19:16] Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And
[Gospel According to Saint John 19:17] And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the
[Gospel According to Saint John 19:19] And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the
[Gospel According to Saint John 19:20] This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus
[Gospel According to Saint John 19:21] Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not,
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:22] Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:23] Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:24] They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:25] Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:26] When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:27] Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:28] After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished,
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:29] Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:30] When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:31] The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:32] Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:33] But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already,
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:35] And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:36] For these things were done, that the scripture should be
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:37] And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:38] And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus,
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:39] And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:40] Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:41] Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 19:42] There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:1] The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:2] Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:3] Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:4] So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:5] And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:6] Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:8] Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:9] For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:10] Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:11] But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:13] And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:14] And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:15] Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:16] Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:17] Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:18] Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:19] Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week,
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:20] And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:21] Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:22] And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:24] But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:25] The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:26] And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:27] Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:28] And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:29] Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 20:30] And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:1] After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:2] There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:3] Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him,
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:4] But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:5] Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:6] And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:7] Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:8] And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:9] As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:10] Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:11] Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:12] Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:13] Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:14] This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:15] So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:16] He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas,
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:17] He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:18] Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:19] This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:20] Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:23] Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:24] This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote
[King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 21:25] And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which,
[Acts of the Apostles 1:1] The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus
[Acts of the Apostles 1:5] For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with
[Acts of the Apostles 1:6] When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying,
[Acts of the Apostles 1:8] But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[Acts of the Apostles 1:9] And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was
[Acts of the Apostles 1:10] And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up,
[Acts of the Apostles 1:12] Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet,
[Acts of the Apostles 1:13] And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room,
[Acts of the Apostles 1:14] These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication,
[Acts of the Apostles 1:15] And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples,
[Acts of the Apostles 1:17] For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this
[Acts of the Apostles 1:18] Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and
[Acts of the Apostles 1:19] And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as
[Acts of the Apostles 1:20] For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be
[Acts of the Apostles 1:21] Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time
[Acts of the Apostles 1:23] And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed
[Acts of the Apostles 1:24] And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts
[Acts of the Apostles 1:26] And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias;
[Acts of the Apostles 2:1] And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with
[Acts of the Apostles 2:2] And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
[Acts of the Apostles 2:3] And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and
[Acts of the Apostles 2:4] And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak
[Acts of the Apostles 2:5] And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of
[Acts of the Apostles 2:6] Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and
[Acts of the Apostles 2:7] And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another,
[Acts of the Apostles 2:12] And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to
[Acts of the Apostles 2:14] But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and
[Acts of the Apostles 2:16] But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; 2:17 And
[Acts of the Apostles 2:22] Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man
[Acts of the Apostles 2:25] For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always
[Acts of the Apostles 2:28] Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me
[Acts of the Apostles 2:29] Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch
[Acts of the Apostles 2:30] Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an
[Acts of the Apostles 2:32] This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
[Acts of the Apostles 2:33] Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having
[Acts of the Apostles 2:34] For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 2:36] Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 2:37] Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 2:39] For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 2:40] And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 2:41] Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 2:42] And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 2:43] And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 2:44] And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 2:45] And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 2:46] And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:1] Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:2] And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:4] And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:5] And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:6] Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:7] And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:8] And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:9] And all the people saw him walking and praising God: 3:10 And they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:11] And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:12] And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:13] The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:14] But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:16] And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:17] And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:18] But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:19] Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:20] And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:22] For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:23] And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:24] Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:25] Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 3:26] Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:1] And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:3] And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:4] Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:5] And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:7] And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:11] This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:12] Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:13] Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:14] And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:15] But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:17] But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:18] And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:19] But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:20] For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:21] So when they had further threatened them, they let them go,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:22] For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:23] And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:24] And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:27] For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:29] And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:31] And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:32] And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:33] And with great power gave the apostles witness of the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:34] Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 4:36] And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:1] But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:3] But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:4] Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:5] And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost:
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:6] And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:7] And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:8] And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:9] Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:10] Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:11] And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:12] And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:13] And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:14] And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:16] There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:17] Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:19] But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:21] And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:22] But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:24] Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:25] Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:26] Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:27] And when they had brought them, they set them before the council:
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:29] Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:30] The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:31] Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:32] And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:33] When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:34] Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:36] For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:37] After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:38] And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:40] And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:41] And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 5:42] And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 6:1] And in those days, when the number of the disciples was
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 6:2] Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 6:3] Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 6:4] But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 6:5] And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 6:7] And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 6:8] And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 6:9] Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 6:10] And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 6:11] Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 6:12] And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 6:13] And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 6:15] And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:1] Then said the high priest, Are these things so? 7:2 And he said,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:4] Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:5] And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:6] And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:7] And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:8] And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:9] And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:11] Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:12] But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:13] And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:14] Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:15] So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:16] And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:17] But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:19] The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:20] In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:22] And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:23] And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:24] And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:26] And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:28] Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday? 7:29
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:30] And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:31] When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:33] Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:34] I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:35] This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:36] He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:37] This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:38] This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:41] And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:42] Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven;
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:44] Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:45] Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:47] But Solomon built him an house.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:48] Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:52] Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:54] When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:55] But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:57] Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:59] And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 7:60] And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:1] And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:2] And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:3] As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:4] Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:5] Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:6] And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:7] For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:8] And there was great joy in that city.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:9] But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:11] And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:12] But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:13] Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:14] Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:18] And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:20] But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:21] Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:22] Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:23] For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:24] Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:25] And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:26] And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:27] And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:28] Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:29] Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:30] And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:32] The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:34] And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:36] And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water:
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:38] And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:39] And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 8:40] But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:1] And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:3] And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:6] And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:7] And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:8] And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:9] And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:10] And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:11] And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:13] Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:15] But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:17] And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:18] And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales:
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:19] And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:20] And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:21] But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:23] And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:25] Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:26] And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:27] But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:28] And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:29] And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:30] Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:31] Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:32] And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:33] And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:34] And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole:
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:35] And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:36] Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:37] And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died:
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:38] And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:39] Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:40] But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:41] And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:42] And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 9:43] And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:1] There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:3] He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:4] And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:5] And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:7] And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:9] On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:13] And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:14] But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:15] And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:16] This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:17] Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:19] While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:20] Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:21] Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:23] Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:24] And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:25] And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:26] But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:27] And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:28] And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:29] Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:32] Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:33] Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:34] Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:36] The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:39] And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:40] Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; 10:41
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:42] And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:43] To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:44] While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:45] And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 10:46] For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:1] And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:2] And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:4] But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:7] And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:8] But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:9] But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:10] And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:11] And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:12] And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:15] And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:16] Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:17] Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:19] Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:20] And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:21] And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:22] Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:23] Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:24] For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith:
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:25] Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: 11:26 And
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:27] And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:28] And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:29] Then the disciples, every man according to his ability,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 11:30] Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:1] Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:2] And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:3] And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:5] Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:6] And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:7] And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:8] And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:9] And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:10] When they were past the first and the second ward, they came
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:11] And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:12] And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:13] And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:14] And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:15] And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:16] But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:17] But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:18] Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:19] And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:20] And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:21] And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:22] And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:23] And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:24] But the word of God grew and multiplied.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 12:25] And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:1] Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:2] As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:3] And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:4] So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:5] And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:6] And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:7] Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:8] But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:9] Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:10] And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:12] Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:13] Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:14] But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:15] And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:16] Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:17] The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:18] And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:19] And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:20] And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:21] And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:22] And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:23] Of this man’s seed hath God according to his promise raised unto
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:25] And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:26] Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:27] For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:28] And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:29] And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:30] But God raised him from the dead: 13:31 And he was seen many
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:32] And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:34] And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:35] Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:36] For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:37] But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:38] Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:40] Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:42] And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:43] Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:44] And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:45] But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:46] Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:47] For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:48] And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:49] And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:50] But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:51] But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 13:52] And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:1] And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:2] But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:3] Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:4] But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:5] And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:8] And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:11] And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:12] And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:13] Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:14] Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:17] Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:18] And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:19] And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:20] Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:21] And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:23] And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:24] And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:25] And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:27] And when they were come, and had gathered the church together,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 14:28] And there they abode long time with the disciples.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:1] And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:2] When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:3] And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:4] And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:5] But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:6] And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:7] And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:8] And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:10] Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:11] But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:12] Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:13] And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:15] And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:16] After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:18] Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:19] Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:21] For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:22] Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:24] Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:25] It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:27] We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:28] For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:30] So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:32] And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:33] And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:34] Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:35] Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:36] And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:37] And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:38] But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:39] And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 15:41] And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:1] Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:3] Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:4] And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:5] And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:6] Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:8] And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:9] And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:10] And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:11] Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:13] And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:14] And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:15] And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:16] And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:18] And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:19] And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:22] And the multitude rose up together against them: and the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:23] And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:25] And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:26] And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:27] And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:28] But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm:
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:29] Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:32] And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:33] And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:34] And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:35] And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:36] And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:37] But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:38] And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:39] And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 16:40] And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:1] Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:4] And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:5] But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:6] And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:8] And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:9] And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:10] And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:11] These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:12] Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:13] But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:14] And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:15] And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:16] Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:17] Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:18] Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:19] And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:21] (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:23] For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:24] God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:25] Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:29] Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:30] And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:32] And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:33] So Paul departed from among them.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 17:34] Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:1] After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:3] And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:4] And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:5] And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:6] And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:7] And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man’s house,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:8] And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:9] Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:11] And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:12] And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:14] And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:16] And he drave them from the judgment seat.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:17] Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:18] And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:19] And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:20] When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:22] And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:23] And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:24] And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:25] This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:26] And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 18:27] And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:1] And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:3] And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:4] Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:5] When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:6] And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:7] And all the men were about twelve.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:8] And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:9] But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:10] And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:11] And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: 19:12 So
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:13] Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:14] And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:15] And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:17] And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:18] And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:19] Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:20] So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:21] After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:22] So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:23] And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:24] For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:25] Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:26] Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:28] And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:29] And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:30] And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:31] And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:32] Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:33] And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:34] But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:35] And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:37] For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:38] Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:39] But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:40] For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 19:41] And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:1] And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:2] And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:4] And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:5] These going before tarried for us at Troas.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:6] And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:7] And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:8] And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:9] And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:10] And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:11] When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:12] And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:13] And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:14] And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:15] And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios;
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:16] For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:17] And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:18] And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:22] And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:24] But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:25] And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:26] Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:27] For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:28] Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:29] For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:30] Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:31] Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:32] And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:33] I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:34] Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:35] I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:36] And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:37] And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 20:38] Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:1] And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:3] Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:4] And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:5] And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:6] And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:7] And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:8] And the next day we that were of Paul’s company departed, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:9] And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:10] And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:11] And when he was come unto us, he took Paul’s girdle, and bound
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:12] And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:13] Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:14] And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:15] And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:16] There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:17] And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:18] And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:19] And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:20] And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:22] What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together:
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:23] Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:25] As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:26] Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:27] And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:29] (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:30] And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:31] And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:32] Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:33] Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:34] And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:35] And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:36] For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:37] And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 21:40] And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:2] (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:4] And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:5] As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:6] And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:7] And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:9] And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid;
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:10] And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:11] And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:12] And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:14] And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:15] For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:16] And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:17] And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:19] And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:21] And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:22] And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:23] And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:25] And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:27] Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:28] And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:29] Then straightway they departed from him which should have
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 22:30] On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:1] And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:2] And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:3] Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall:
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:6] But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:7] And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:8] For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:9] And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:10] And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:11] And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:12] And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:13] And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:14] And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:15] Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:16] And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:17] Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:18] So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:19] Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:20] And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:21] But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:22] So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:23] And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:25] And he wrote a letter after this manner: 23:26 Claudius Lysias
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:27] This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:28] And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:30] And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:31] Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:32] On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 23:34] And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:1] And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:2] And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:4] Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:5] For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:7] But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:9] And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:10] Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:11] Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:12] And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:14] But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:16] And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:17] Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:18] Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:19] Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:20] Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:22] And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:23] And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:24] And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:25] And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:26] He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 24:27] But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:1] Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:2] Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:4] But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:5] Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:6] And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:7] And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:8] While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:9] But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:11] For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:12] Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:13] And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:14] And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:16] To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:17] Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:18] Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:20] And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:21] But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:22] Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:23] And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:24] And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:25] But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:26] Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 25:27] For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:1] Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:4] My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:6] And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:8] Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:10] Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:11] And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:12] Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:14] And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:15] And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:16] But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:19] Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:21] For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:22] Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:24] And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:25] But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:26] For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:27] King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:28] Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:29] And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:30] And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 26:32] Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:1] And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:2] And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:3] And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:4] And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:5] And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:6] And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:7] And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:9] Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:11] Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:12] And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:13] And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:14] But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:15] And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:16] And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:18] And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:20] And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:21] But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:22] And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:23] For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:25] Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:26] Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:27] But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:29] Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:30] And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:32] Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:33] And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:34] Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:35] And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:36] Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:37] And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:38] And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:39] And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:40] And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:41] And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:42] And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 27:43] But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:1] And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:2] And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:3] And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:4] And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:5] And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:6] Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:7] In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:8] And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:9] So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:11] And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria,
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:12] And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:13] And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:15] And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:16] And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:17] And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:18] Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:19] But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:20] For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:21] And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:22] But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:23] And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:24] And some believed the things which were spoken, and some
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:25] And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:28] Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:29] And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had
[Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I 28:30] And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 1:1] Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 1:8] First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 1:9] For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 1:11] For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 1:13] Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 1:14] I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 1:15] So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 1:16] For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 1:17] For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 1:18] For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 1:20] For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 1:22] Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 1:23 And
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 1:24] Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 1:25] Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 1:26] For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 1:28] And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 2:1] Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 2:2] But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 2:3] And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 2:12] For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 2:13] (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 2:14] For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 2:17] Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 2:21] Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 2:25] For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 2:26] Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 3:1] What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 3:3] For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 3:5] But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 3:9] What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 3:10] As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: 3:11
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 3:12] They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 3:13] Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 3:19] Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 3:20] Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 3:21] But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 3:25] Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 3:27] Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works?
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 3:28] Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 3:29] Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles?
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 3:31] Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 4:1] What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 4:3] For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 4:4] Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 4:5] But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 4:6] Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 4:8] Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 4:9] Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 4:10] How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 4:11] And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 4:13] For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 4:14] For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 4:16] Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 4:18] Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 4:19] And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 4:22] And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 4:23] Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 5:1] Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 5:3] And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 5:6] For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 5:7] For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 5:8] But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 5:9] Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 5:10] For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 5:11] And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 5:12] Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 5:14] Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 5:15] But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 5:16] And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 5:17] For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 5:19] For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 5:20] Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:1] What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:5] For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:7] For he that is dead is freed from sin.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:8] Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:10] For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:11] Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:12] Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:13] Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:14] For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:15] What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:16] Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:18] Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:19] I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:20] For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:21] What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:22] But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 6:23] For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:1] Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,)
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:3] So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:4] Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:5] For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:6] But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:7] What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:8] But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:9] For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:10] And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:11] For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:12] Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:13] Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:14] For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:15] For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not;
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:16] If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:17] Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:18] For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:19] For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:20] Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:21] I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:22] For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: 7:23 But I
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 7:24] O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:1] There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:2] For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:3] For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:5] For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh;
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:6] For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:7] Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:8] So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:9] But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:10] And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:11] But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:12] Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:13] For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:14] For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:15] For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:16] The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:18] For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:19] For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:20] For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:22] For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:23] And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:24] For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:26] Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:27] And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:28] And we know that all things work together for good to them that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:29] For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:30] Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:31] What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:34] Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:35] Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:37] Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:38] For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 8:39] Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:1] I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:3] For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:6] Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:8] That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:9] For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:10] And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:13] As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:14] What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:15] For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:16] So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:17] For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:18] Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:19] Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:26] And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:27] Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:29] And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:30] What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:31] But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 9:32] Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 10:1] Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 10:2] For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 10:3] For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 10:4] For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 10:5] For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 10:6] But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 10:10] For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 10:11] For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 10:12] For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 10:13] For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 10:14] How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 10:18] But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 10:19] But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 10:20] But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 10:21] But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:1] I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:2] God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:4] But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:5] Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:6] And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:7] What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for;
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:8] (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:9] And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:11] I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:12] Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:15] For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:17] And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:19] Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:20] Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:22] Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:23] And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:24] For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:26] And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:28] As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:29] For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:30] For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:32] For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 11:33] O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 12:1] I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 12:2] And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 12:3] For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 12:4] For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 12:6] Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 12:9] Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil;
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 12:10] Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 12:14] Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 12:15] Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 12:16] Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 12:17] Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 12:18] If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 12:19] Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 12:20] Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 12:21] Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 13:1] Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 13:2] Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 13:3] For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 13:5] Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 13:6] For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 13:7] Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 13:8] Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 13:9] For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 13:10] Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 13:11] And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 13:12] The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 13:13] Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 13:14] But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:1] Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:2] For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:3] Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:4] Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:5] One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:6] He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:7] For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:8] For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:9] For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:10] But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:11] For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:12] So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:13] Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:14] I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:15] But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:16] Let not then your good be evil spoken of: 14:17 For the kingdom
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:18] For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:19] Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:20] For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:21] It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:22] Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 14:23] And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:1] We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:2] Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:3] For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:4] For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:5] Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:7] Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:8] Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:9] And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:10] And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:11] And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:12] And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:13] Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:14] And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:15] Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:17] I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:18] For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:20] Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:22] For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:23] But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:25] But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:26] For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:27] It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:28] When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:29] And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:30] Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 15:33] Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:1] I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:3] Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus: 16:4 Who
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:5] Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:6] Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:7] Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:8] Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:9] Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:10] Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:11] Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:12] Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:13] Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:14] Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:15] Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:16] Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:17] Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:18] For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:19] For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:20] And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:21] Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:22] I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:23] Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:24] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans 16:25] Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:1] Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:4] I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:9] God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:10] Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:11] For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:12] Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:13] Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:16] And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:17] For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:18] For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:19] For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:20] Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:22] For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:23] But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:25] Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:26] For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:30] But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:1] And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:2] For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:3] And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:4] And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:6] Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:9] But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:10] But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:11] For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:12] Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:13] Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:14] But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:15] But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:16] For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:1] And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:2] I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:3] For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:7] So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:8] Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:9] For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:10] According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:11] For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:12] Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:14] If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:15] If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:16] Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:18] Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:19] For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:20] And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:21] Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:22] Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:1] Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:2] Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:3] But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:4] For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:5] Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:6] And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:7] For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:9] For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:10] We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:11] Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:14] I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:15] For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:16] Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:17] For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:18] Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:19] But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:20] For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:21] What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:2] And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:3] For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:6] Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:9] I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:10] Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:11] But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:12] For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:1] Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:4] If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:5] I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:7] Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:9] Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:10] Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:11] And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:12] All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient:
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:13] Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:14] And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:15] Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:16] What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:17] But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:18] Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body;
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:19] What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:1] Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:2] Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:3] Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:4] The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:5] Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:6] But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:7] For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:8] I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:9] But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:10] And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:12] But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:13] And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:14] For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:15] But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:16] For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:18] Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:19] Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:20] Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:21] Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:22] For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:23] Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:24] Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:25] Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:26] I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:27] Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:28] But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:29] But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:31] And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:32] But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:34] There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:35] And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:36] But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:37] Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:38] So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:39] The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:40] But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:1] Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:2] And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:3] But if any man love God, the same is known of him.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:4] As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:5] For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:7] Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:8] But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:9] But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:10] For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:13] Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:1] Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:3] Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, 9:4 Have we not
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:11] If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:13] Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:15] But I have used none of these things: neither have I written
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:16] For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:18] What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:19] For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:20] And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews;
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:22] To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:23] And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:24] Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:25] And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:26] I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:1] Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:5] But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:6] Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:7] Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:8] Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:9] Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:10] Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:11] Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:12] Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:13] There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man:
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:14] Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:15] I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:16] The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:18] Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:21] Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:22] Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:23] All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient:
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:24] Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s wealth.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:25] Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:27] If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:28] But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:32] Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:1] Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:2] Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:3] But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ;
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:4] Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:5] But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:6] For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:7] For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:8] For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:9] Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:10] For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:11] Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:12] For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:13] Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:16] But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:17] Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:18] For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:19] For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:20] When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:21] For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:22] What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:23] For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:25] After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:26] For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:27] Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:28] But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:29] For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:30] For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:31] For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:32] But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:33] Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:34] And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:1] Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:2] Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:3] Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:4] Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:5] And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:6] And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:7] But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:8] For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:12] For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:13] For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:14] For the body is not one member, but many.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:15] If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:19] And if they were all one member, where were the body? 12:20 But
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:21] And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee:
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:22] Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:24] For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:25] That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:26] And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it;
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:27] Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:28] And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:29] Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:1] Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:2] And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:3] And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:4] Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:8] Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:9] For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:10] But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:11] When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:12] For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face:
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:13] And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:1] Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:2] For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:3] But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:4] He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:5] I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:6] Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:10] There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:11] Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:12] Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:13] Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:14] For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:15] What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:16] Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:18] I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: 14:19 Yet
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:20] Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:21] In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:22] Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:23] If therefore the whole church be come together into one place,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:26] How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:27] If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:28] But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:29] Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:30] If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:31] For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:32] And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:33] For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:34] Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:35] And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:36] What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:38] But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:39] Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 14:40] Let all things be done decently and in order.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:1] Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:2] By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:3] For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:7] After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:8] And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:9] For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:10] But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:11] Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:12] Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:14] And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:15] Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:16] For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: 15:17 And
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:18] Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:19] If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:20] But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:21] For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:22] For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:23] But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits;
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:24] Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:25] For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:26] The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:27] For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:28] And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:29] Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:32] If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:33] Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:34] Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:35] But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:39] All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:40] There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:41] There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:42] So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:45] And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul;
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:46] Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:47] The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:48] As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:49] And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:50] Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:51] Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:53] For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:54] So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:55] O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:56] The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:57] But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 15:58] Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:1] Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:2] Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:3] And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:4] And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:5] Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia:
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:6] And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:7] For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:8] But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:9] For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:10] Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear:
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:11] Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:12] As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:13] Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:14] Let all your things be done with charity.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:15] I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:17] I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:18] For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:19] The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:20] All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:21] The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:22] If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:23] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 16:24] My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:1] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:3] Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:5] For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:6] And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:7] And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:8] For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:12] For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:13] For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:15] And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:17] When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:19] For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:20] For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:21] Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:23] Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 1:24] Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:1] But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:2] For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:4] For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:5] But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part:
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:6] Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:7] So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:8] Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:9] For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:10] To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:12] Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:14] Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 2:15] For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:1] Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:4] And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: 3:5 Not that we
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:7] But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:10] For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:11] For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:12] Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:15] But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:16] Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:17] Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 3:18] But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:1] Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:3] But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: 4:4 In
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:5] For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:6] For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:7] But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:8] We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:11] For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:12] So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:13] We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:15] For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:16] For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 4:17] For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:1] For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:2] For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:4] For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:5] Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:6] Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:9] Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:10] For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:11] Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:12] For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:13] For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:14] For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:16] Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:17] Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:18] And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:19] To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:20] Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 5:21] For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:1] We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:2] (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:8] By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:11] O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:12] Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:13] Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,)
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:14] Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:17] Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 6:18] And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:1] Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:2] Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:3] I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:4] Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:5] For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:6] Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:8] For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:9] Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:10] For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:11] For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:12] Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:13] Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:14] For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed;
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:15] And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 7:16] I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:1] Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:3] For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:5] And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:6] Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:7] Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:8] I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:9] For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:10] And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:11] Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:12] For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:13] For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: 8:14 But
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:16] But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:17] For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:18] And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:22] And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:23] Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 8:24] Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:1] For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:3] Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:5] Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:6] But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:7] Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give;
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:8] And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:10] Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:12] For the administration of this service not only supplieth the
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 9:15] Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:1] Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:3] For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:4] (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:7] Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:8] For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:10] For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:11] Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:12] For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:13] But we will not boast of things without our measure, but
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:14] For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:17] But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 10:18] For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:1] Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:2] For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:3] But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:4] For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:5] For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:6] But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:7] Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:8] I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:9] And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:10] As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:11] Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:12] But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:13] For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:14] And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:15] Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:16] I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:17] That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:18] Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:19] For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:20] For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:21] I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:22] Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:23] Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:24] Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:25] Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:28] Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:29] Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:30] If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:31] The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 11:32] In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:1] It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:2] I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:3] And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:5] Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:6] For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:7] And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:8] For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:9] And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:10] Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:11] I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:12] Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:13] For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:14] Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:15] And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:16] But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:17] Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:18] I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 12:20] For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:1] This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:2] I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:4] For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:5] Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:7] Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:8] For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:9] For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:10] Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:11] Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:12] Greet one another with an holy kiss.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:13] All the saints salute you.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 13:14] The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 1:1] Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 1:6] I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 1:8] But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 1:9] As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 1:10] For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men?
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 1:11] But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 1:12] For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 1:13] For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 1:15] But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 1:18] Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 1:19] But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 1:20] Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 1:21] Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; 1:22 And
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 1:23] But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 1:24] And they glorified God in me.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 2:1] Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 2:2] And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 2:3] But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 2:6] But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 2:8] (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 2:10] Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 2:11] But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 2:12] For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 2:13] And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 2:14] But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 2:17] But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 2:18] For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 2:19] For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 2:20] I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 2:21] I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:1] O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:5] He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:7] Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:8] And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:9] So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:10] For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse:
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:11] But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:12] And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:13] Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:15] Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:16] Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:17] And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:18] For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise:
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:19] Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:20] Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:21] Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:22] But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:23] But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:24] Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:25] But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:26] For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:27] For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:28] There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 3:29] And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:1] Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:3] Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:6] And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:7] Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:8] Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:9] But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:11] I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:12] Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:13] Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:14] And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:15] Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:16] Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:17] They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:18] But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:19] My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:21] Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:23] But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:24] Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants;
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:25] For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:26] But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:27] For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:28] Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:29] But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:30] Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 4:31] So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:1] Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:2] Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:3] For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:4] Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:5] For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:6] For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:7] Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:9] A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:10] I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:11] And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:12] I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:13] For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:14] For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:15] But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:16] This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:17] For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:18] But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:19] Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these;
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:22] But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:24] And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:25] If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 5:26] Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:1] Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:2] Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:3] For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:4] But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:5] For every man shall bear his own burden.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:6] Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:7] Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:8] For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:9] And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:10] As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:11] Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:12] As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:13] For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:14] But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:15] For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:16] And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:17] From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians 6:18] Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 1:1] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 1:2] Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 1:3] Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 1:4] According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 1:5] Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 1:7] In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 1:13] In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 1:15] Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 1:20] Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 2:1] And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 2:2] Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 2:4] But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 2:8] For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 2:10] For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 2:11] Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 2:14] For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 2:18] For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 2:19] Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 3:1] For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 3:8] Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 3:13] Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 3:14] For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 3:16] That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 3:20] Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 4:1] I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 4:4] There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 4:7] But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 4:8] Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 4:9] (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 4:17] This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 4:20] But ye have not so learned Christ; 4:21 If so be that ye have
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 4:25] Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 4:26] Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 4:28] Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 4:29] Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 4:30] And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 4:31] Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:1] Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; 5:2 And walk
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:3] But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:5] For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:6] Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:7] Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:8] For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord:
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:11] And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:12] For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:13] But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light:
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:14] Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:15] See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:16] Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:17] Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:18] And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:20] Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:22] Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:23] For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:24] Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:25] Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:28] So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:29] For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:31] For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:32] This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 5:33] Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 6:1] Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 6:2] Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 6:4] And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 6:5] Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 6:9] And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 6:10] Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 6:11] Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 6:12] For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 6:13] Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 6:14] Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 6:17] And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 6:21] But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 6:23] Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Ephesians 6:24] Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 1:1] Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 1:3] I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 1:4 Always in every
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 1:8] For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 1:9] And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 1:11] Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 1:12] But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 1:15] Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 1:18] What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 1:19] For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 1:21] For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 1:22] But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 1:23] For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 1:25] And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 1:27] Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 1:29] For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:1] If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:3] Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:4] Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:5] Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 2:6 Who,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:7] But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:9] Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:12] Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:13] For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:14] Do all things without murmurings and disputings: 2:15 That ye may
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:17] Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:18] For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:19] But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:20] For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:21] For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:22] But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:23] Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:24] But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:25] Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:26] For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:27] For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him;
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:28] I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 2:29] Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 3:1] Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 3:2] Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 3:3] For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 3:4] Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 3:6] Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 3:7] But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 3:8] Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 3:9] And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 3:12] Not as though I had already attained, either were already
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 3:13] Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 3:15] Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 3:16] Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 3:17] Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 3:18] (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:1] Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:2] I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:3] And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:4] Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:5] Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:6] Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:7] And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:8] Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:9] Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:10] But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:11] Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:12] I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:13] I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:14] Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:15] Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:16] For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:17] Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:18] But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:19] But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:20] Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:21] Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:22] All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 4:23] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:1] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:3] We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:4] Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:5] For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:6] Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:7] As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:8] Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:9] For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:10] That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:11] Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:12] Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:13] Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:14] In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:15] Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:16] For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:17] And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:18] And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:19] For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:20] And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:21] And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:22] In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:23] If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:24] Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:25] Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:26] Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:27] To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:28] Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 1:29] Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:1] For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:2] That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:3] In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:4] And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:5] For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:6] As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:7] Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:8] Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:9] For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:10] And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:11] In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:12] Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:13] And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:14] Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:15] And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:16] Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:17] Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:18] Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:19] And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:20] Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:21] (Touch not; taste not; handle not;
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:22] Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 2:23] Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:1] If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:2] Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:3] For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:4] When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:5] Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:6] For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:7] In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:8] But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:9] Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:10] And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:11] Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:12] Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:13] Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:14] And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:15] And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:16] Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:17] And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:18] Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:19] Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:20] Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:21] Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:22] Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:23] And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:24] Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 3:25] But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:1] Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:2] Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:3] Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:4] That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:5] Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:6] Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:7] All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:8] Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:9] With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:10] Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister’s son
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:11] And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:12] Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:13] For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:14] Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:15] Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:16] And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:17] And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 4:18] The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 1:1] Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 1:2] We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 1:5] For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 1:6] And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 1:7] So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 1:8] For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 1:9] For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:1] For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:3] For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:5] For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:7] But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:9] For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:10] Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:13] For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:14] For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:17] But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:18] Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:19] For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:1] Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:4] For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:5] For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:6] But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:9] For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:12] And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 4:1] Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 4:2] For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 4:3] For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 4:7] For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 4:8] He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 4:9] But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you:
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 4:10] And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 4:13] But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 4:14] For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 4:15] For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 4:16] For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 4:18] Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:1] But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:2] For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:3] For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:4] But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:5] Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:6] Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:7] For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:8] But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:9] For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:11] Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:12] And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:14] Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:15] See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:16] Rejoice evermore.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:17] Pray without ceasing.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:18] In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:19] Quench not the Spirit.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:20] Despise not prophesyings.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:21] Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:22] Abstain from all appearance of evil.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:23] And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:24] Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:25] Brethren, pray for us.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:26] Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:27] I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 5:28] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 1:1] Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 1:3] We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 1:11] Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:1] Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:3] Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:5] Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:7] For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:8] And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:11] And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:13] But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:15] Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 2:16] Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:1] Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:3] But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:4] And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:5] And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:6] Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:7] For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:10] For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:11] For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:12] Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:13] But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:14] And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:15] Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians 3:16] Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means.
[Lord be with you all. 3:17] The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in
[Lord be with you all. 3:18] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:1] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:3] As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:5] Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:8] But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; 1:9
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:12] And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:14] And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:15] This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:16] Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:17] Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:18] This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:1] I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:3] For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:4] Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:5] For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:7] Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:8] I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:9] In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:11] Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:12] But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:13] For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:14] And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:15] Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:1] This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:2] A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:7] Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without;
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:8] Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:10] And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:11] Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:12] Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:13] For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:14] These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:15] But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:16] And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:1] Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:4] For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:6] If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:7] But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:8] For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:9] This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:10] For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:11] These things command and teach.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:12] Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:13] Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:14] Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:15] Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:16] Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them:
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:1] Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:3] Honour widows that are widows indeed.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:4] But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:5] Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:6] But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:7] And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:8] But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:9] Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:10] Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:11] But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:13] And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:14] I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:15] For some are already turned aside after Satan.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:16] If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:17] Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:18] For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:19] Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:20] Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:21] I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:22] Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:23] Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:24] Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment;
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 5:25] Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 6:1] Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 6:2] And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 6:3] If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 6:6] But godliness with contentment is great gain.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 6:7] For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 6:8] And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 6:9] But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 6:10] For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 6:11] But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 6:12] Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life,
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 6:13] I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 6:17] Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
[First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 6:20] O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:1] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:3] I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:6] Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:7] For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:8] Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:12] For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:13] Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:14] That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:15] This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:16] The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 1:18] The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:1] Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:2] And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:3] Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:4] No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:5] And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:6] The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:7] Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:8] Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:10] Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:11] It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:14] Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:15] Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:16] But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:17] And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:19] Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:20] But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:21] If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:22] Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:23] But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 2:24] And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:1] This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:2] For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:6] For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:8] Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:9] But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:10] But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:12] Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:13] But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:14] But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 3:16] All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:1] I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:2] Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:3] For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine;
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:5] But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:6] For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:7] I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:9] Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: 4:10 For Demas hath
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:11] Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:12] And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:13] The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:14] Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:16] At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me:
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:17] Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:18] And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:19] Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:20] Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:21] Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee,
[Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy 4:22] The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 1:1] Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 1:5] For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 1:7] For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 1:10] For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 1:12] One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 1:13] This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 1:15] Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 1:16] They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 2:1] But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: 2:2 That
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 2:3] The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 2:6] Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 2:7] In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 2:9] Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 2:11] For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 2:13] Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 2:15] These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 3:1] Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 3:3] For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 3:4] But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 3:8] This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 3:9] But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 3:10] A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 3:12] When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 3:13] Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 3:14] And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Titus 3:15] All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon 1:1] Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon 1:4] I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, 1:5
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon 1:7] For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon 1:8] Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon 1:10] I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon 1:15] For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon 1:18] If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon 1:20] Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon 1:21] Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon 1:22] But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon 1:23] There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon 1:24] Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Philemon 1:25] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 1:1] God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 1:5] For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 1:7] And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 1:8] But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 1:9] Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 1:10] And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 1:13] But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 2:2] For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 2:3] How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 2:6] But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 2:7] Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 2:8] Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 2:9] But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 2:10] For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 2:11] For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 2:13] And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 2:14] Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 2:15] And deliver them who through fear of death were all their
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 2:16] For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 2:17] Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 2:18] For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 3:1] Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 3:2] Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 3:3] For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 3:4] For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 3:5] And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 3:7] Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 3:10] Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 3:11] So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.) 3:12
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 3:13] But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 3:14] For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 3:16] For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 3:17] But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 4:1] Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 4:2] For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 4:3] For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 4:4] For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 4:5] And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 4:6] Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 4:7] Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 4:8] For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 4:9] There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 4:10] For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 4:11] Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 4:12] For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 4:13] Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight:
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 4:14] Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 4:15] For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 4:16] Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 5:1] For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 5:3] And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 5:4] And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 5:5] So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest;
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 5:6] As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 5:7] Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 5:9] And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 5:11] Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 5:12] For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 5:13] For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 5:14] But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 6:1] Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 6:3] And this will we do, if God permit.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 6:4] For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 6:7] For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 6:9] But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 6:10] For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 6:11] And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 6:13] For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 6:15] And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 6:16] For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 6:17] Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:1] For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:4] Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:5] And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:7] And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:8] And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:9] And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:10] For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:11] If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:13] For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:14] For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:15] And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:17] For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:18] For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:19] For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:20] And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest: 7:21 (For
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:23] And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:25] Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:26] For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:27] Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 7:28] For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 8:1] Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 8:3] For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices:
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 8:4] For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 8:6] But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 8:7] For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 8:8] For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 8:10] For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 8:12] For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 8:13] In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 9:1] Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 9:2] For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 9:3] And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 9:6] Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 9:7] But into the second went the high priest alone once every year,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 9:11] But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 9:13] For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 9:16] For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 9:17] For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 9:18] Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 9:19] For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 9:21] Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 9:22] And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 9:23] It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 9:24] For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 9:27] And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:1] For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:2] For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:3] But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:4] For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:5] Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:7] Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:8] Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:10] By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:11] And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:14] For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:15] Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:18] Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:19] Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:23] Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering;
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:26] For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:28] He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:30] For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:31] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:32] But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:34] For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:35] Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:36] For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:37] For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:38] Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 10:39] But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:1] Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:2] For by it the elders obtained a good report.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:3] Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:4] By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:5] By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:6] But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:7] By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:8] By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:9] By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:11] Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:12] Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:13] These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:14] For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:15] And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:16] But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly:
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:17] By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:20] By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:21] By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:22] By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:23] By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:24] By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:27] By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king:
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:28] Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:29] By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:30] By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:31] By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:32] And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:34] Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:35] Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 11:39] And these all, having obtained a good report through faith,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 12:1] Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 12:3] For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 12:4] Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 12:5] And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 12:7] If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 12:9] Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 12:11] Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 12:12] Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 12:14] Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 12:17] For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 12:18] For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 12:19] And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 12:25] See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 12:27] And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 12:28] Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:1] Let brotherly love continue.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:2] Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:3] Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:4] Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:5] Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:6] So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:7] Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:8] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:9] Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:10] We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:11] For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:12] Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:13] Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:14] For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:15] By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:16] But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:17] Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:18] Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:19] But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:20] Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:22] And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:23] Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom,
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:24] Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints.
[Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews 13:25] Grace be with you all. Amen.
[General Epistle of James 1:1] James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[General Epistle of James 1:2] My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers
[General Epistle of James 1:4] But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and
[General Epistle of James 1:5] If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all
[General Epistle of James 1:6] But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth
[General Epistle of James 1:7] For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the
[General Epistle of James 1:8] A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.
[General Epistle of James 1:9] Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: 1:10
[General Epistle of James 1:11] For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it
[General Epistle of James 1:12] Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is
[General Epistle of James 1:13] Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God
[General Epistle of James 1:15] Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin,
[General Epistle of James 1:16] Do not err, my beloved brethren.
[General Epistle of James 1:17] Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh
[General Epistle of James 1:18] Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we
[General Epistle of James 1:19] Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear,
[General Epistle of James 1:21] Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of
[General Epistle of James 1:22] But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your
[General Epistle of James 1:23] For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like
[General Epistle of James 1:25] But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
[General Epistle of James 1:26] If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his
[General Epistle of James 1:27] Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To
[General Epistle of James 2:1] My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord
[General Epistle of James 2:2] For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in
[General Epistle of James 2:10] For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
[General Epistle of James 2:11] For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.
[General Epistle of James 2:12] So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law
[General Epistle of James 2:13] For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no
[General Epistle of James 2:14] What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith,
[General Epistle of James 2:18] Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me
[General Epistle of James 2:19] Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils
[General Epistle of James 2:20] But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
[General Epistle of James 2:21] Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had
[General Epistle of James 2:24] Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by
[General Epistle of James 2:25] Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when
[General Epistle of James 2:26] For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
[General Epistle of James 3:1] My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive
[General Epistle of James 3:2] For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word,
[General Epistle of James 3:3] Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us;
[General Epistle of James 3:4] Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are
[General Epistle of James 3:5] Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.
[General Epistle of James 3:7] For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of
[General Epistle of James 3:9] Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we
[General Epistle of James 3:10] Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My
[General Epistle of James 3:11] Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and
[General Epistle of James 3:13] Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him
[General Epistle of James 3:14] But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory
[General Epistle of James 3:15] This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual,
[General Epistle of James 3:16] For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every
[General Epistle of James 3:17] But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable,
[General Epistle of James 3:18] And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make
[General Epistle of James 4:1] From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not
[General Epistle of James 4:3] Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume
[General Epistle of James 4:4] Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of
[General Epistle of James 4:5] Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that
[General Epistle of James 4:7] Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will
[General Epistle of James 4:8] Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your
[General Epistle of James 4:9] Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to
[General Epistle of James 4:10] Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you
[General Epistle of James 4:11] Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of
[General Epistle of James 4:12] There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who
[General Epistle of James 4:15] For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do
[General Epistle of James 4:16] But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
[General Epistle of James 4:17] Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to
[General Epistle of James 5:1] Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall
[General Epistle of James 5:2] Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.
[General Epistle of James 5:3] Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a
[General Epistle of James 5:4] Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your
[General Epistle of James 5:5] Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have
[General Epistle of James 5:6] Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.
[General Epistle of James 5:7] Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.
[General Epistle of James 5:8] Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the
[General Epistle of James 5:9] Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned:
[General Epistle of James 5:10] Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of
[General Epistle of James 5:11] Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the
[General Epistle of James 5:12] But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven,
[General Epistle of James 5:13] Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him
[General Epistle of James 5:14] Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church;
[General Epistle of James 5:16] Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another,
[General Epistle of James 5:17] Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed
[General Epistle of James 5:18] And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth
[General Epistle of James 5:19] Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert
[First Epistle General of Peter 1:1] Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
[First Epistle General of Peter 1:3] Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
[First Epistle General of Peter 1:6] Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be,
[First Epistle General of Peter 1:10] Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
[First Epistle General of Peter 1:11] Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which
[First Epistle General of Peter 1:12] Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us
[First Epistle General of Peter 1:13] Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to
[First Epistle General of Peter 1:16] Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.
[First Epistle General of Peter 1:17] And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons
[First Epistle General of Peter 1:22] Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through
[First Epistle General of Peter 1:24] For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower
[First Epistle General of Peter 1:25] But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word
[First Epistle General of Peter 2:1] Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies,
[First Epistle General of Peter 2:4] To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men,
[First Epistle General of Peter 2:6] Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in
[First Epistle General of Peter 2:7] Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them
[First Epistle General of Peter 2:9] But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
[First Epistle General of Peter 2:10] Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of
[First Epistle General of Peter 2:11] Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain
[First Epistle General of Peter 2:13] Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake:
[First Epistle General of Peter 2:15] For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to
[First Epistle General of Peter 2:17] Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
[First Epistle General of Peter 2:18] Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to
[First Epistle General of Peter 2:19] For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God
[First Epistle General of Peter 2:20] For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye
[First Epistle General of Peter 2:21] For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered
[First Epistle General of Peter 2:25] For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the
[First Epistle General of Peter 3:1] Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that,
[First Epistle General of Peter 3:3] Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the
[First Epistle General of Peter 3:5] For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who
[First Epistle General of Peter 3:7] Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge,
[First Epistle General of Peter 3:8] Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another,
[First Epistle General of Peter 3:10] For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain
[First Epistle General of Peter 3:12] For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are
[First Epistle General of Peter 3:13] And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
[First Epistle General of Peter 3:15] But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to
[First Epistle General of Peter 3:17] For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
[First Epistle General of Peter 3:18] For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
[First Epistle General of Peter 3:21] The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not
[First Epistle General of Peter 4:1] Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm
[First Epistle General of Peter 4:3] For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the
[First Epistle General of Peter 4:6] For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are
[First Epistle General of Peter 4:7] But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and
[First Epistle General of Peter 4:8] And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for
[First Epistle General of Peter 4:9] Use hospitality one to another without grudging.
[First Epistle General of Peter 4:10] As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same
[First Epistle General of Peter 4:11] If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man
[First Epistle General of Peter 4:12] Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is
[First Epistle General of Peter 4:14] If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the
[First Epistle General of Peter 4:15] But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an
[First Epistle General of Peter 4:16] Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but
[First Epistle General of Peter 4:17] For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of
[First Epistle General of Peter 5:1] The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and
[First Epistle General of Peter 5:4] And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown
[First Epistle General of Peter 5:5] Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all
[First Epistle General of Peter 5:6] Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he
[First Epistle General of Peter 5:8] Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a
[First Epistle General of Peter 5:10] But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal
[First Epistle General of Peter 5:11] To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
[First Epistle General of Peter 5:12] By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have
[First Epistle General of Peter 5:13] The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you,
[First Epistle General of Peter 5:14] Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you
[Second General Epistle of Peter 1:1] Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them
[Second General Epistle of Peter 1:5] And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue;
[Second General Epistle of Peter 1:8] For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye
[Second General Epistle of Peter 1:9] But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar
[Second General Epistle of Peter 1:10] Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your
[Second General Epistle of Peter 1:12] Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in
[Second General Epistle of Peter 1:13] Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir
[Second General Epistle of Peter 1:15] Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to
[Second General Epistle of Peter 1:16] For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made
[Second General Epistle of Peter 1:17] For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there
[Second General Epistle of Peter 1:18] And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with
[Second General Epistle of Peter 1:19] We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well
[Second General Epistle of Peter 1:21] For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but
[Second General Epistle of Peter 2:1] But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there
[Second General Epistle of Peter 2:2] And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the
[Second General Epistle of Peter 2:3] And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
[Second General Epistle of Peter 2:4] For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down
[Second General Epistle of Peter 2:11] Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not
[Second General Epistle of Peter 2:12] But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and
[Second General Epistle of Peter 2:17] These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a
[Second General Epistle of Peter 2:18] For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure
[Second General Epistle of Peter 2:19] While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants
[Second General Epistle of Peter 2:20] For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world
[Second General Epistle of Peter 2:21] For it had been better for them not to have known the way of
[Second General Epistle of Peter 2:22] But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The
[Second General Epistle of Peter 3:1] This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which
[Second General Epistle of Peter 3:5] For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God
[Second General Epistle of Peter 3:8] But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is
[Second General Epistle of Peter 3:9] The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
[Second General Epistle of Peter 3:10] But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the
[Second General Epistle of Peter 3:11] Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner
[Second General Epistle of Peter 3:14] Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be
[Second General Epistle of Peter 3:15] And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even
[Second General Epistle of Peter 3:17] Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware
[Second General Epistle of Peter 3:18] But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour
[First Epistle General of John 1:1] That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we
[First Epistle General of John 1:4] And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.
[First Epistle General of John 1:5] This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare
[First Epistle General of John 1:6] If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness,
[First Epistle General of John 1:8] If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth
[First Epistle General of John 1:9] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
[First Epistle General of John 1:10] If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his
[First Epistle General of John 2:1] My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin
[First Epistle General of John 2:3] And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his
[First Epistle General of John 2:4] He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a
[First Epistle General of John 2:5] But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God
[First Epistle General of John 2:6] He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk,
[First Epistle General of John 2:7] Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old
[First Epistle General of John 2:8] Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in
[First Epistle General of John 2:9] He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in
[First Epistle General of John 2:10] He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is
[First Epistle General of John 2:11] But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in
[First Epistle General of John 2:12] I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven
[First Epistle General of John 2:13] I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from
[First Epistle General of John 2:14] I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that
[First Epistle General of John 2:15] Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If
[First Epistle General of John 2:16] For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust
[First Epistle General of John 2:17] And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that
[First Epistle General of John 2:18] Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that
[First Epistle General of John 2:19] They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had
[First Epistle General of John 2:20] But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.
[First Epistle General of John 2:21] I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but
[First Epistle General of John 2:22] Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is
[First Epistle General of John 2:23] Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that
[First Epistle General of John 2:24] Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the
[First Epistle General of John 2:25] And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal
[First Epistle General of John 2:26] These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce
[First Epistle General of John 2:27] But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you,
[First Epistle General of John 2:28] And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall
[First Epistle General of John 2:29] If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that
[First Epistle General of John 3:1] Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
[First Epistle General of John 3:2] Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear
[First Epistle General of John 3:3] And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even
[First Epistle General of John 3:4] Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is
[First Epistle General of John 3:5] And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in
[First Epistle General of John 3:6] Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not
[First Epistle General of John 3:7] Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth
[First Epistle General of John 3:8] He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from
[First Epistle General of John 3:9] Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed
[First Epistle General of John 3:10] In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the
[First Epistle General of John 3:11] For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we
[First Epistle General of John 3:12] Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.
[First Epistle General of John 3:13] Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.
[First Epistle General of John 3:14] We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love
[First Epistle General of John 3:15] Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no
[First Epistle General of John 3:16] Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life
[First Epistle General of John 3:17] But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have
[First Epistle General of John 3:19] And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our
[First Epistle General of John 3:20] For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and
[First Epistle General of John 3:21] Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
[First Epistle General of John 3:22] And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
[First Epistle General of John 3:23] And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name
[First Epistle General of John 3:24] And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in
[First Epistle General of John 4:1] Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
[First Epistle General of John 4:2] Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth
[First Epistle General of John 4:4] Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because
[First Epistle General of John 4:5] They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the
[First Epistle General of John 4:6] We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of
[First Epistle General of John 4:7] Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every
[First Epistle General of John 4:8] He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
[First Epistle General of John 4:9] In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God
[First Epistle General of John 4:10] Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and
[First Epistle General of John 4:11] Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
[First Epistle General of John 4:12] No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God
[First Epistle General of John 4:13] Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he
[First Epistle General of John 4:14] And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to
[First Epistle General of John 4:15] Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God
[First Epistle General of John 4:16] And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God
[First Epistle General of John 4:17] Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the
[First Epistle General of John 4:18] There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear:
[First Epistle General of John 4:19] We love him, because he first loved us.
[First Epistle General of John 4:20] If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar:
[First Epistle General of John 5:1] Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and
[First Epistle General of John 5:2] By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love
[First Epistle General of John 5:3] For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and
[First Epistle General of John 5:4] For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is
[First Epistle General of John 5:5] Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that
[First Epistle General of John 5:7] For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the
[First Epistle General of John 5:8] And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and
[First Epistle General of John 5:9] If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater:
[First Epistle General of John 5:10] He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself:
[First Epistle General of John 5:11] And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life,
[First Epistle General of John 5:12] He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of
[First Epistle General of John 5:13] These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of
[First Epistle General of John 5:14] And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask
[First Epistle General of John 5:16] If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he
[First Epistle General of John 5:17] All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
[First Epistle General of John 5:18] We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is
[First Epistle General of John 5:19] And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in
[First Epistle General of John 5:20] And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an
[First Epistle General of John 5:21] Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
[Second Epistle General of John 1:1] The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in
[Second Epistle General of John 1:3] Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from
[Second Epistle General of John 1:4] I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth,
[Second Epistle General of John 1:5] And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new
[Second Epistle General of John 1:6] And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the
[Second Epistle General of John 1:7] For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not
[Second Epistle General of John 1:8] Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have
[Second Epistle General of John 1:9] Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of
[Second Epistle General of John 1:10] If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive
[Second Epistle General of John 1:12] Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with
[Second Epistle General of John 1:13] The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
[Third Epistle General of John 1:1] The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
[Third Epistle General of John 1:2] Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be
[Third Epistle General of John 1:3] For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of
[Third Epistle General of John 1:4] I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
[Third Epistle General of John 1:5] Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
[Third Epistle General of John 1:8] We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers
[Third Epistle General of John 1:9] I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the
[Third Epistle General of John 1:10] Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth,
[Third Epistle General of John 1:11] Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good.
[Third Epistle General of John 1:12] Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself:
[Third Epistle General of John 1:13] I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write
[General Epistle of Jude 1:1] Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them
[General Epistle of Jude 1:3] Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common
[General Epistle of Jude 1:4] For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of
[General Epistle of Jude 1:5] I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this,
[General Epistle of Jude 1:6] And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their
[General Epistle of Jude 1:7] Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like
[General Epistle of Jude 1:8] Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
[General Epistle of Jude 1:9] Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he
[General Epistle of Jude 1:10] But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but
[General Epistle of Jude 1:11] Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran
[General Epistle of Jude 1:12] These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with
[General Epistle of Jude 1:14] And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
[General Epistle of Jude 1:16] These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts;
[General Epistle of Jude 1:17] But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of
[General Epistle of Jude 1:19] These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the
[General Epistle of Jude 1:20] But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith,
[General Epistle of Jude 1:22] And of some have compassion, making a difference: 1:23 And others
[General Epistle of Jude 1:24] Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 1:1] The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 1:3] Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 1:4] John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 1:7] Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 1:8] I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 1:9] I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 1:10] I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 1:12] And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 1:14] His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 1:16] And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 1:17] And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 1:19] Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:1] Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:4] Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:5] Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:6] But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:7] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:8] And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:10] Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:11] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:12] And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:14] But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:15] So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:16] Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:17] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:18] And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:20] Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:21] And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:22] Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:23] And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:24] But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:25] But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:26] And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:28] And I will give him the morning star.
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 2:29] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:1] And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:2] Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:3] Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:4] Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:5] He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment;
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:6] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:7] And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:9] Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:10] Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:11] Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:12] Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:13] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:14] And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:16] So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:17] Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:19] As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:20] Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:21] To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 3:22] He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 4:1] After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 4:2] And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 4:3] And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 4:4] And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 4:5] And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 4:6] And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal:
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 4:7] And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 4:8] And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 4:9] And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 5:1] And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 5:2] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 5:4] And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 5:5] And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 5:6] And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 5:7] And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 5:8] And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 5:9] And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 5:11] And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 5:13] And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 5:14] And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 6:1] And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 6:2] And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 6:3] And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 6:4] And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 6:5] And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 6:6] And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 6:7] And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 6:8] And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 6:9] And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 6:12] And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 6:14] And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together;
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 6:15] And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 7:2] And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 7:4] And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 7:5] Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 7:6] Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 7:7] Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 7:8] Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 7:9] After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 7:11] And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 7:13] And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 7:15] Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 7:16] They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 7:17] For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 8:1] And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 8:2] And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 8:3] And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 8:4] And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 8:5] And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 8:6] And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 8:7] The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 8:8] And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 8:10] And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 8:12] And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 8:13] And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:2] And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:3] And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:4] And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:5] And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:6] And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:7] And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:8] And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:9] And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:10] And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:11] And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:12] One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:13] And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:15] And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:16] And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:17] And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:18] By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:19] For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 9:20] And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 10:1] And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 10:4] And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 10:5] And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 10:8] And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 10:9] And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 10:10] And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 10:11] And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:1] And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:2] But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:3] And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:4] These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:5] And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:6] These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:7] And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:8] And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:9] And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:10] And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:11] And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:12] And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:13] And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:14] The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:15] And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:16] And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:18] And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 11:19] And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 12:1] And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 12:3] And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 12:4] And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 12:5] And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 12:6] And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 12:7] And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 12:9] And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 12:10] And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 12:11] And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 12:12] Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 12:13] And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 12:14] And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 12:15] And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 12:16] And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 12:17] And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 13:1] And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 13:2] And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 13:3] And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 13:4] And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast:
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 13:6] And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 13:7] And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 13:8] And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 13:9] If any man have an ear, let him hear.
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 13:10] He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 13:11] And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 13:12] And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 13:13] And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 13:15] And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 13:16] And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 13:18] Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:1] And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:2] And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:4] These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:5] And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:6] And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:8] And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:9] And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:11] And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever:
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:12] Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:13] And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:14] And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:15] And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:16] And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth;
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:17] And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:18] And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:19] And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 14:20] And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 15:1] And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 15:2] And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 15:3] And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 15:4] Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 15:5] And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 15:7] And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 15:8] And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:1] And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:2] And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:3] And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:4] And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:5] And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:6] For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:7] And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:8] And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:9] And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:10] And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:12] And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:13] And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:14] For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:15] Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:16] And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:17] And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:18] And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:19] And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:20] And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 16:21] And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:1] And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:3] So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:4] And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:5] And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:6] And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:7] And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:8] The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:9] And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:10] And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:11] And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:12] And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:13] These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:14] These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:15] And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:16] And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:17] For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 17:18] And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:1] And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:2] And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:3] For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:4] And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:5] For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:6] Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:7] How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:8] Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:9] And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:11] And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her;
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:14] And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:15] The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:16] And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:20] Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:21] And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:22] And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 18:24] And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:1] And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:3] And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:4] And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:5] And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:6] And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:7] Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:8] And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:9] And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:10] And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:11] And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:12] His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:13] And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:14] And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:15] And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:16] And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:17] And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:19] And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:20] And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 19:21] And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 20:1] And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 20:2] And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 20:4] And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 20:5] But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 20:6] Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection:
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 20:7] And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 20:9] And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 20:10] And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 20:11] And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 20:12] And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 20:13] And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 20:14] And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 20:15] And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:1] And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:2] And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:3] And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:4] And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:5] And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:6] And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:7] He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:8] But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:9] And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:10] And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:14] And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:15] And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:16] And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:17] And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:18] And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:19] And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:20] The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:21] And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:22] And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:23] And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:24] And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:25] And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:26] And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 21:27] And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:1] And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:2] In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:3] And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:5] And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle,
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:6] And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:7] Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:8] And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:9] Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:10] And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:11] He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:12] And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:13] I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:14] Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:15] For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:16] I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:17] And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:18] For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:20] He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.
[Revelation of Saint John the Divine 22:21] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
